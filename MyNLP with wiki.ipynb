      "Dookie is the third studio album by the American rock band Green Day, released on February 1, 1994, by Reprise Records. The band's major label debut and first collaboration with producer Rob Cavallo, it was recorded in mid-1993 at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California. Written mostly by frontman and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, the album is largely based on his personal experiences and includes themes such as boredom, anxiety, relationships, and sexuality. It was promoted with four singles: \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", a re-recorded version of \"Welcome to Paradise\" (which originally appeared on the band's second studio album, 1991's Kerplunk), and \"When I Come Around\".\n",
      "After several years of grunge's dominance in popular music, Dookie brought a livelier, more melodic rock sound to the mainstream and propelled Green Day to worldwide fame. Considered one of the defining albums of the 1990s and of punk rock in general, it was also pivotal in solidifying the genre's mainstream popularity. Its influence continued into the new millennium and beyond, being cited as an inspiration by many punk and pop-punk bands as well as artists from other genres.\n",
      "Dookie received critical acclaim upon its release, although some early fans called the band a sellout for leaving its independent label (Lookout! Records) and embracing a more polished sound. The record won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album in 1995. It was a worldwide success, peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 in the United States and reaching top ten positions in several other countries. Dookie was later certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It has sold over 20 million copies worldwide, making it the band's best-selling album and one of the best-selling albums of all time. It has been labeled by critics and journalists as one of the greatest albums of the 1990s and one of the greatest punk rock and pop-punk albums of all time. Rolling Stone placed Dookie on three iterations of its \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list, and at number 1 on its \"50 Greatest Pop-Punk Albums\" list.A 30th-anniversary deluxe edition of the album, released on September 29, 2023, includes outtakes, demos, and two live concert recordings.\n",

      "== Background ==\n",
      "With the success in the independent world of their first two albums 39/Smooth (1990) and Kerplunk (1991), which sold 30,000 units each, a number of major record labels became interested in Green Day. Among those labels were Sony, Warner Bros., Geffen and Interscope. Representatives of these labels attempted to entice the band to sign by inviting them for meals to discuss a deal, with one manager even inviting the group to Disneyland. The band declined these advances; Armstrong believed that the labels were more than likely looking for something that resembled a grunge band, namely \"second- and third-rate Nirvanas and Soundgardens\", and they did not want to conform to a label's vision. That changed when they met producer and A&R representative Rob Cavallo of Reprise, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. The band played Beatles covers for him for 40 minutes, then Cavallo picked up his own guitar and jammed with them. They were impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could really talk to and connect with\".Eventually, the band left their independent record label, Lookout! Records, on friendly terms. They signed a five-album deal with Reprise in April 1993. The deal secured Cavallo as the producer of the first record and allowed the band to retain the rights to its albums on Lookout!. Signing to a major label caused many of Green Day's original fans to label them sell-outs, including the influential punk fanzine Maximumrocknroll and the independent music club 924 Gilman Street. After Green Day's September 3 gig at 924 Gilman Street, the venue banned the group from entering or playing. Reflecting back on the period, lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure [...] The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" The group later returned in 2015 to play a benefit concert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Recording ==\n",
      "Following the band's last Gilman Street performance, Green Day demoed the songs \"She\", \"Sassafras Roots\", \"Pulling Teeth\" and \"F.O.D.\" on Armstrong's four-track tape recorder and sent it to Cavallo. After listening to it, Cavallo sensed that \"[he] had stumbled on something big.\" However, he recognized that the band members were struggling to play their best; he reasoned that they were anxious because the most time they had previously spent recording an album was three days while recording Kerplunk. To lighten the mood, he invited them to a Mexican restaurant and bar down the street from Fantasy Studios, even though drummer Tré Cool was not of legal drinking age at the time. Armstrong confirmed the band's anxiety in an interview years later, describing the group feeling \"like little kids in a candy store\" and fearing that the band would lose money on work being scrapped by the label for not meeting standards. Despite this, they focused on making the most of the new production resources at their disposal; unlike their previous albums where the band had to rush to complete them to save money, the band took their time to perfect the quality of their output. Armstrong noted that he learned \"how to dial in good sounds, get the best guitar tones. I was able to take a little time doing vocals.\"Recording took place over the course of three weeks at Fantasy, and the album was mixed twice by Jerry Finn. Though the band took their time to make a quality product as a whole, Armstrong's vocals were still recorded very quickly; he recorded about 16 or 17 songs in two days, most of them in a single take. Armstrong said the band at first \"wanted it to sound really dry, the same way the Sex Pistols record or the early Black Sabbath records sounded\", but the band found the result of this approach to be an unsatisfactory original mix. Cavallo agreed, and it was remixed at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California. Armstrong later said of their studio experience, \"Everything was already written, all we had to do was play it.\" Among the material recorded but not included on the album was \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\", which would later be re-recorded for the band's 1997 album Nimrod and become a hit in its own right. The band also recorded new versions of the songs \"Welcome to Paradise\" and \"Christie Rd.\" from their second album Kerplunk and \"409 in your Coffeemaker\" from their second EP Slappy, though only \"Welcome to Paradise\" would make it onto the final album.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Writing and composition ==\n",
      "Much of Dookie's content was written by Armstrong, except \"Emenius Sleepus\", which was written by bassist Mike Dirnt, and the hidden track, \"All by Myself\", which was written by drummer Tré Cool. The album touched upon various experiences of the band members and included subjects such as anxiety and panic attacks, masturbation, sexual orientation, boredom, mass murder, divorce, domestic abuse, and ex-girlfriends. PopMatters summarized the album's theme as \"a record that speaks of the frustrations, anxieties, and apathy of young people\". Stylistically, the album has been categorized primarily as punk rock, but also as pop-punk and as a \"power pop take\" on skate punk. Influences from the Ramones and the Sex Pistols were noted in Armstrong's guitar technique throughout the album; he recorded the album almost entirely with his Fernandes Stratocaster, which he named \"Blue\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Songs 1–7 ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Dookie opens with \"Burnout\", a \"speedy, antsy rocker\" centered around a central character's feelings of general apathy toward life. Armstrong wrote the song \"Having a Blast\" when he was in Cleveland in June 1992. The song revolves around a mentally ill character who plans to use explosives to kill himself and others. This was not regarded as a serious issue at the time, as the social climate could allow the song to be viewed as \"mere cathartic fantasy\", but later incidents such as the 1999 Columbine High School massacre have made the song the \"most uncomfortable track\" on the album. On \"Chump\", Armstrong takes the perspective of someone who shows prejudice, insulting another person without actually knowing him or her. At the end of the song, it is revealed that the disliked person in question matches Armstrong's description of himself. \"Chump\" is also the first of three songs that allude to \"Amanda\", a former girlfriend of Armstrong's. The album's first single, \"Longview\", had a signature bass line that bassist Dirnt wrote while under the influence of LSD. In an interview with Guitar World in 2002, Armstrong described the character in the song as based on himself when he lived in Rodeo, California: \"There was nothing to do there, and it was a real boring place.\" To entertain himself, the character does nothing but watch television, smoke marijuana, and masturbate, and has little motivation to change these habits despite tiring of the same cycle of behaviors.\"Welcome to Paradise\", the third single from Dookie, originally appeared on the band's second studio album, Kerplunk!. The newer version has better sound quality. The song was written about Armstrong's experiences living in bad neighborhoods around Oakland, California. \"Pulling Teeth\", one of the album's slower songs, uses dark humor about domestic violence. The typical victim and perpetrator are reversed; the male narrator is at the mercy of his partner. The band's inspiration for this song came from a pillow fight between Dirnt and his girlfriend that ended with the bassist breaking his elbow. The second single, \"Basket Case\", which appeared on many singles charts worldwide, was also inspired by Armstrong's personal experiences. The song deals with Armstrong's anxiety attacks and feelings of \"going crazy\" before being diagnosed with a panic disorder. Using a palm mute, Armstrong is the only one who plays on the song until halfway through the song's first chorus, with the other instruments' arrival representing panic setting in. In the third verse, \"Basket Case\" mentions soliciting a male prostitute; Armstrong said, \"I wanted to challenge myself and whoever the listener might be. It's also looking at the world and saying, 'It's not as black and white as you think. This isn't your grandfather's prostitute – or maybe it was.' \" The music video was filmed in an abandoned mental institution. It is one of the band's most popular songs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Songs 8–14 ===\n",
      "\"She\" was written about Amanda, who showed him a feminist poem entitled \"She\". In return, Armstrong wrote the lyrics of \"She\" and showed them to her. When Amanda broke up with Armstrong in early 1994 and moved to Ecuador to join the Peace Corps, Armstrong decided to put \"She\" on the album. Musically, \"She\" is similar to \"Basket Case\", although it is slightly faster, and draws inspiration from the Beatles. The song's beginnings mirror those of \"Basket Case\"; whereas Armstrong was the only one to play as \"Basket Case\" began, Armstrong's guitar does not enter until later in \"She\" while his bandmates provide a musical backdrop. The song tells the story of a young woman who feels trapped in an unsatisfactory life. Amanda is also referenced in the next track, \"Sassafras Roots\". Sonically closer to the band's material on Kerplunk!, it is an unconventional love song that uses irony and sarcasm in an effort to avoid being direct, and centers on a couple wasting time together in a romantic relationship. The tenth track, \"When I Come Around\", was the album's final single. It was inspired by Adrienne Nesser, Armstrong's girlfriend and now wife. Following a dispute between the couple, Armstrong left Nesser to spend some time alone. Described as the closest thing to a ballad on the album, \"When I Come Around\" is driven by a recognizable two-bar, palm-muted guitar riff of four chords, while Dirnt's bass part stands out by adding additional pulled-off and hammered-on portions to the guitar's accompaniment. The song's lyrics highlight two meanings of its title: the narrator begins by talking to someone they believe they could address the needs of, having literally come around; in the second verse, the singer realizes they aren't what the other person needs, having \"come around\" figuratively.The song \"Coming Clean\" deals with Armstrong's coming to terms with his bisexuality as a teenager. At the time, he was still looking for himself sexually and had no well-defined sexual orientation. In his interview with The Advocate magazine, he said that although he has never had a relationship with a man, his sexuality has been \"something that comes up as a struggle in me\". \"Emenius Sleepus\", written by Dirnt, is about two old friends who meet by chance, and the narrator realizes that they have both changed a lot as people. Played in a quick staccato-styled rhythm, Armstrong wrote the song \"In the End\" about his mother and stepfather, and the reproach Armstrong felt toward his mother for choosing his stepfather as a partner. \"F.O.D.\", an acronym for \"Fuck Off and Die\", begins calmly with Armstrong alone on acoustic guitar, before the band suddenly arrives in a louder, full-force fashion. The theme of the song centers around the singer's grudge for another individual, and wishing misfortune upon them.\n",
      "A hidden track, \"All By Myself\", with vocals and guitar by Cool, plays after \"F.O.D.\" ends, and is themed on masturbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Packaging ==\n",
      "Dookie is American slang for feces. It is a reference to the diarrhea—\"liquid dookie\"—that the band members suffered while eating spoiled food on tour. Initially, the band aimed name the album Liquid Dookie, but this was shortened to Dookie. Asked in 2014 if the choice was a mistake in hindsight, Armstrong said it had been an impulsive \"stoner thing\": \"We were smoking a lot of weed [and said] 'Hey, man, wouldn't it be funny if...'\"For its cover art, the band commissioned artist Richie Bucher, who created a cartoon-like work depicting bombs being dropped on people and buildings. Bucher says Armstrong only told him the album's title, so he worked around the theme of fecal matter. As a child, Bucher had associated feces with dogs and monkeys, both of which appear prominently on the album's cover.The setting is a replica of Berkeley's Telegraph Avenue. In the center, there is an explosion with the band's name at the top. The cover depicts Patti Smith showing off her armpit as shown on the cover of her album Easter (1977), a shootout surrounding Black Panther Party co-founder Huey P. Newton, the woman on Black Sabbath's self-titled debut album, Angus Young of AC/DC, and the Sather Tower. Friends of the band members are among the foreground figures on whom dogs and monkeys throw their excrement. A dog pilots the plane that drops bombs with the words Dookie written on them, while the name of the group is written in brown in the center of the explosion. Oil refineries in Rodeo, California, can be seen in the distance.Armstrong has since explained the meaning of the artwork:\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted the art work to look really different. I wanted it to represent the East Bay and where we come from, because there's a lot of artists in the East Bay scene that are just as important as the music. So we talked to Richie Bucher. He did a 7-inch cover for this band called Raooul that I really liked. He's also been playing in bands in the East Bay for years. There's pieces of us buried on the album cover. There's one guy with his camera up in the air taking a picture with a beard. He took pictures of bands every weekend at Gilman's. The robed character that looks like the Mona Lisa is the woman on the cover of the first Black Sabbath album. AC/DC guitarist Angus Young is in there somewhere too. The graffiti reading \"Twisted Dog Sisters\" refers to these two girls from Berkeley. I think the guy saying \"The fritter, fat boy\" was a reference to a local cop.\n",
      "When the trio went to Warner's offices in Los Angeles to discuss marketing for the album, label officials initially wanted the cover to feature a photograph of the comely young men, but the band refused. George Weiss, Warner's marketing director, noted that the band came from a distinctly different culture than most of their artists, and Green Day had gained the leverage with the label to insist on a different choice. The back cover on early prints of the CD featured a plush toy of Ernie from Sesame Street, which was airbrushed out of later prints for fear of litigation; however, Canadian and European prints still feature Ernie on the back cover. Some rumors suggest that it was removed because it led parents to think that Dookie was a child's lullaby album or that the creators of Sesame Street had sued Green Day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Release ==\n",
      "While rehearsing in the house they rented in Berkeley at the end of 1993 in anticipation of a tour for Dookie, the band was invited to the Warner offices in Los Angeles to discuss the marketing strategy around the album with Weiss. The latter expected to meet three scornful young men with reputations in punk music, when in reality the band members were intimidated to even be invited to the meeting. They discussed the first single, \"Longview\", as well as projected goals for the album's sales: Cavallo hoped to sell at least 200,000 units, while Cool looked higher toward 500,000. Demand was well underestimated; when Dookie was released on February 1, 1994, the album's first 9,000 produced copies quickly sold out. \"Longview\" was released as the album's lead single simultaneously with the album. Despite promising demand from the quick depletion of the album's initial supply, it initially resulted in modest total sales as strategies were adjusted to meet demand, and only after the music video for \"Longview\" debuted on MTV on February 22 did the album begin to attract stronger attention, first entering the Billboard 200 rankings at number 127.In March, the group made appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Jon Stewart Show and 120 Minutes on MTV. Sales for Dookie rose greatly following these performances, peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 in the United States. The record became an international success as well; the album peaked in the top ten of the German, Finnish, Norwegian, Dutch, Swedish, and Swiss charts, while it topped the Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand charts. By June 14, Dookie was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having sold more than 500,000 copies in the United States. That month, an issue of Time hailed the album as a work creating an impact comparable to Nirvana's Nevermind (1991).On August 1, \"Basket Case\" was released as the album's second single. The song's music video quickly became an MTV staple. The following month, \"Longview\" was nominated in three categories at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards. Green Day performed the unreleased song \"Armatage Shanks\" at the ceremony, which would later appear on their following album Insomniac (1995), but did not win any of the categories which they were nominated for. In October, Warner proposed \"Welcome to Paradise\" to be the third single, noting potential to make good sales. However, Armstrong refused because the song evoked a part of his life and he did not feel capable of promoting it with a music video. The song was ultimately only broadcast on the radio domestically, being met with great success despite not being sold to the public. An exclusive United Kingdom single release for the song did proceed on October 17. Near the end of 1994, Don Pardo invited the band to perform on Saturday Night Live.Ahead of the 37th Annual Grammy Awards, \"When I Come Around\" was released to radio as the album's final single in December 1994. The band had been nominated in four Grammy Award categories: Best Alternative Music Album, Best New Artist, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal with \"Basket Case\", and Best Hard Rock Performance with \"Longview\". They won only the former of the categories. In the meantime, \"When I Come Around\" had been quickly climbing the charts; it held the top of the Billboard Modern Rock Chart for seven weeks and peaked at number six of the Hot 100 Airplay chart, becoming the band's most successful single from the album. Throughout the 1990s, Dookie continued to sell well, eventually receiving diamond certification from the RIAA in 1999, signifying ten million copies sold. By 2014, Dookie had sold over 20 million copies worldwide and remains the band's best-selling album.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Reception ==\n",
      "Dookie was released to positive reviews. In early 1995, Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote, \"Punk turns into pop in fast, funny, catchy, high-powered songs about whining and channel-surfing; apathy has rarely sounded so passionate.\" Rolling Stone's Paul Evans described Green Day as \"convincing mainly because they've got punk's snotty anti-values down cold: blame, self-pity, arrogant self-hatred, humor, narcissism, fun\". Jesse Raub, writing for Alternative Press, praised \"Burnout\" for immediately opening with a \"huge, polished production value without abandoning their scrappy, loose punk playing\" which consistently shines through the rest of the album's tracks. In a 20th anniversary retrospective review for Billboard, Chris Payne highlighted how Armstrong's \"sugary, almost bubblegum choruses\" were unique for punk at the time, and forcefully brought mainstream attention to punk rock music.The Chicago Tribune's Greg Kot was appreciative of the loudness and urgency in the album's sound, detecting influences from the Who and the Zombies. NME showcased the record's \"crashing drums\" and \"razor-wire guitars\", concluding, \"being dumb has never been so much fun.\" A 2017 review from Pitchfork's Marc Hogan summarized the album's material as \"buzzing, hook-crammed tracks that acted like they didn't give a shit\", but resounded so well with its audience because in truth \"on a compositional and emotional level they were actually gravely serious,\" praising the album's outlandish artwork for helping ease the tense nature of the music. Robert Christgau, writing for The Village Voice, opined that \"punk lives, and these guys have the toons and sass to prove it to those who can live without,\" praising their themes of apathy, insanity, poverty, and \"the un-American way\".Neil Strauss of the New York Times, while complimentary of the album's overall quality, followed up Pareles' review by noting that Dookie's pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. The band did not respond initially to these comments, but later claimed that they were \"just trying to be themselves\" and that \"it's our band, we can do whatever we want\". Dirnt claimed that the follow-up album, Insomniac, one of the band's most aggressive albums lyrically and musically, was the band releasing their anger at all the criticism and distaste from critics and former fans. On the other hand, Thomas Nassiff at Fuse cited it as the most important pop-punk album.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Legacy ==\n",
      "Green Day's Dookie—along with the Offspring's Smash, released two months later—has been credited for helping bring punk rock back into mainstream music culture. NME argues, \"Dookie's success proved to record label, film and TV [executives] that the teen rock revolution they had been witnessing for much of the early '90s didn't have to be all gloomy nihilism and angsty sonics. Dookie made rock fun again.\" In 2012, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Dookie as \"a stellar piece of modern punk that many tried to emulate but nobody bettered\". On the album's twentieth anniversary, The Daily Beast wrote that before its release \"rock meant grunge: heavy, monotonic, humorless, and bleak\", but the lighter tone of Dookie changed the public's general understanding of the term. It \"made the entire pop-punk movement possible...it shaped the way people looked, dressed, danced, and spent their summers. Odeley  [sic] is fantastic. So is OK Computer. But neither record triggered the sort of commercial tsunami of compatriots and copycats that followed in Dookie's wake.\" Berkeley-based Rancid was one of the first bands to capitalize on the hype created by Green Day and the Offspring with ...And Out Come the Wolves, giving the new punk rock movement stability.Some critics claim that Dookie allowed numerous similar artists to enjoy long careers, including Rancid, New Found Glory, Fall Out Boy, Panic! At The Disco, Blink-182, Simple Plan, and Yellowcard. Good Charlotte guitarist Billy Martin, Something Corporate frontman Andrew McMahon, and Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley all claim stylistic influence from the album. NME believes Blink-182's Enema of the State (1999), Sum 41's All Killer No Filler (2001), My Chemical Romance's The Black Parade (2006), and even Lady Gaga's The Fame (2008) could not have been created without Dookie. Gaga has said that the album was the first she ever purchased.In 2014, the year of its twentieth anniversary, the album received several list accolades. In April 2014, Rolling Stone placed the album at No. 1 on its \"1994: The 40 Best Records From Mainstream Alternative's Greatest Year\" list, ahead of Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral and Weezer's self-titled debut. A month later, Loudwire placed Dookie at No. 1 on its \"10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1994\" list. Guitar World ranked Dookie at number thirteen in their list \"Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994\" that July. Rolling Stone cited it as one of the greatest punk rock albums of all time in 2016, and NME ranked it as the 18th-best album of 1994, alongside \"Welcome to Paradise\" as a top-50 song for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Accolades ===\n",
      "Dookie has appeared on many prominent \"must have\" lists compiled by the music media, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Live performances ==\n",
      "In mid-1993, while recording and mixing the album, Green Day opened for several Bad Religion concerts, allowing them to play new songs to a live audience. However, unlike their previous shows, the band was now playing before audiences of two to three thousand people. Two weeks after the release of Dookie, the band embarked on an international tour. In the United States, they traveled between shows in a bookmobile belonging to Tré Cool's father. From late April to early June 1994, the band toured Europe, playing around 40 concerts in the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Sweden. The band's popularity was still rising slowly when they arrived in Europe; in Belgium, the audience numbered about 200 people. Cavallo recorded a few performances during the tour, to show the three young men their evolution on stage, and for use as B-sides on later releases.\n",
      "After the European tour, Armstrong proposed to Nesser after four years of on-and-off relationships. Because the tour prevented them from properly planning their wedding and their honeymoon, the two married in a small ceremony on July 2, 1994, attended only by Green Day's two other members and their girlfriends. Adrienne discovered she was pregnant the next day, and Armstrong was upset about being unable to help and care for her. The trio then joined the second leg of Lollapalooza as the main attraction, and program directors set them to play the opening of the main stage. They missed a date of the traveling festival to perform on August 14 at Woodstock '94. This event, the 25th anniversary of the original 1969 festival in Saugerties, New York, saw a mud \"fight\" between the band and the crowd. Although organizers hoped that Green Day would be a big draw, their punk rock style stuck out at the event and the band's performance was poorly received by the crowd. When they opened their set with \"Welcome to Paradise\" after three days of rain, the audience was provoked by the irony and threw mud at them. Armstrong responded by taunting the crowd, and the event escalated into a mud fight among the audience and the band. During the fight, Dirnt was mistaken for a fan by a security guard, who tackled him and then threw him against a monitor, injuring his arm and breaking two of his teeth. Broadcast on pay-per-view to millions of people, this performance was widely noticed internationally and sales of the album rose sharply.Further controversy followed the band only weeks later at a free concert in Boston. Alternative radio station WFNX hosted a free Green Day concert at the Hatch Memorial Shell concert venue on September 9, 1994. However, the promoters were accustomed to hosting reggae and acts of similar softness that drew smaller crowds, and were unprepared for the audience of 70,000 to 100,000 people. The fans in attendance were already chanting for Green Day during the show's opening act. After several calls for calm, including some from Armstrong, the group began their performance, but the singer let himself be carried away by the energy of the audience and jumped into the middle of it during \"Longview\", the seventh song of the set. The security forces, overwhelmed and fearing that the lighting fixtures would collapse, forcibly ended the concert by cutting off the power. A riot ensued and spilled into the streets, leading to numerous arrests and injuries. The Massachusetts State Police were called. Roughly 100 people were injured and 31 were arrested in the aftermath of the concert. The Boston Phoenix would list the Green Day Hatch Shell \"riot\" concert as the sixth-greatest Boston concert of all time.When the band returned to Europe in October 1994, the venues in which they played were much larger, and the band was met with much more enthusiasm. Despite their new notoriety for live performances, the trio continued to sell tickets at affordable prices: $5 to $20 (equivalent to $10 to $40 in 2022). Warner proposed several groups to play as opening acts on this tour, but the band rejected these; instead, the band invited German punk band Die Toten Hosen and the American queercore group Pansy Division to join their shows. Following the European shows, the band returned home for one last show at the Z100 Acoustic Christmas at Madison Square Garden in New York. An AIDS benefit show, Armstrong performed the song \"She\" naked, using his guitar to cover himself.In 2013, the band played Dookie in its entirety at some European dates as a celebration of the album's upcoming 20th anniversary. On October 19, 2023, at the Fremont Country Club in Las Vegas, Dookie was played in its entirety as part of the evening's 29-song set, including \"All by Myself\". The album was played in celebration of its upcoming 30th anniversary and announcement of the 2024 tour.\n",

      "Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career, they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children. They were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.\n",
      "Though the albums Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997) and Warning (2000) did not match the success of Dookie, they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum status, while Warning achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a rock opera called American Idiot (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré!, released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially, in comparison to their previous albums, largely due to a lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. They were followed by Revolution Radio (2016), which became their third to debut at No. 1 on the  Billboard 200, Father of All Motherfuckers (2020) and Saviors (2024).\n",
      "In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design, winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, their first year of eligibility. Members of the band have collaborated on the side projects Pinhead Gunpowder, The Network, Foxboro Hot Tubs, The Longshot and The Coverups. They have also worked on solo careers.\n",
      "Green Day has sold roughly 75 million records worldwide as of 2024, making them one of the best-selling music artists. The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy Awards and won five of them, with Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording.\n",

      "=== Formation and Lookout! years (1987–1993) ===\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1987, friends and guitarists Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, along with bassist Sean Hughes and drummer Raj Punjabi, a fellow student from Pinole Valley High School, formed band \"Blood Rage\", the name taken from the eponymous film, and played together in Raj's father's house garage at Rodeo, California; a few months later, the band renamed to Sweet Children. One of their first songs written together was \"Best Thing in Town\". The group's first live performance under the name Sweet Children took place on October 17, 1987, at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as \"Al Sobrante\", who replaced original drummer Raj Punjabi. It was around this time that bassist Sean Hughes also left the band, causing Dirnt to switch from guitar to bass. Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman, who would later contact Armstrong to fill in as a possible second guitarist for their band Rancid) as a major influence and a group that inspired him to form a band.In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed them to his label. In April 1989, the band released its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Shortly before the EP's release, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band, Sweet Baby. Sweet Children adopted the name Green Day, instead, due to the members' fondness for cannabis. The phrase \"green day\" was slang in the Bay Area, where the band originated, for spending a day doing nothing but smoking marijuana. Armstrong once admitted in 2001 that he considered it to be \"the worst band name in the world\".Lookout! released Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day recorded two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth as 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Kiffmeyer left the East Bay area to attend Humboldt State University in Arcata, California. The Lookouts' drummer Tré Cool began filling in temporarily and later permanently, an offer which Kiffmeyer \"graciously accepted\". The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993 and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. By then, the band's second studio album Kerplunk had sold 50,000 copies in the U.S. Green Day supported another California punk band, Bad Religion, as an opening act for their Recipe for Hate Tour for most of 1993.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Signing with Reprise Records and breakthrough success (1993–1995) ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Kerplunk's underground success led to interest from major record labels and a bidding war to sign Green Day. The band eventually left Lookout! and signed with Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could talk to and connect with\". Reflecting on this period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure … The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band began recording its major-label debut, Dookie. On September 3, 1993, Green Day played their last show at 924 Gilman under the pseudonym Blair Hess before being banned permanently because of their major label signing.Recorded in three weeks and released in February 1994, Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. The album went on to sell over 10 million copies in the US. At a performance on September 9, 1994, at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs), and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where at the latter the group started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album, and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year. In the band's homestead of the East Bay following Dookie's success, the band felt a sense of unwelcoming. Billie Joe Armstrong recalled aggressive glares and furtive whispers. The band's success would trickle onto other East Bay bands such as Jawbreaker, a local favorite of Armstrong's, which garnered accusations of selling out during a concert attended by Armstrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Middle years and decline in popularity (1995–2002) ===\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1995, a single entitled \"J.A.R.\" for the Angus soundtrack was released and debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.  The band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, was released in Fall 1995. Compared to the more melodic Dookie, Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity. The album opened to warm critical reception, earning 4 of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\" The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Stuck with Me\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", and \"Walking Contradiction\".\n",
      "Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold three million copies in the United States. The album earned the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" earned the band nominations for Best Video, Short Form, at the Grammy's, in addition to Best Special Effects at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly canceled a European tour, citing exhaustion.Following a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began work on its next album in 1997. From the outset, Cavallo and the band agreed the album had to be different from Green Day's previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard melodic punk rock. The album was released in October 1997 and provided a variety of music, from punk, pop, hardcore, folk, surf rock, ska, to the acoustic ballad \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\". Nimrod entered the charts at Number 10. The mainstream success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was used in the second clip show episode of Seinfeld and two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\", and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 1999, Jason White began supporting the band during concerts as guitarist.In 2000, Green Day released their folk-punk-inspired sixth studio album Warning and, in support, participated in that year's Warped Tour. In November 2000, in a show produced by Ian Brennan, the band performed for free on the steps on San Francisco's City Hall to protest the eviction of artists from the city. The band also launched an independent tour to support the album Warning in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied. AllMusic gave it 4.5/5, saying, \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\" Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5 and saying, \"Warning … invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and smaller hit \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached at least triple platinum sales, Warning was only certified gold.At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards for which it was nominated. The group won awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist.The release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits! had a companion collection of music videos entitled International Supervideos! Shenanigans contained collected B-sides including \"Espionage\", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.In Spring 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182, documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys.\n",

      "In Summer 2003, the band wrote and recorded material for an album tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the taken material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the band, who concealed their identities with masks and costumes, released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands. The bands \"feuded\" via press releases and statements from Armstrong. Several journalists openly referred to the group as a Green Day side project, although it was not confirmed as such until 2013.\n",
      "Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. \n",
      "Finally, American Idiot was released in September 2004 and debuted at number one on the Billboard charts. Backed by the success of the album's first single \"American Idiot\", it was the band's first album to reach this pinnacle. American Idiot was labeled a punk rock opera and follows the journey of the fictitious \"Jesus of Suburbia\". The album depicts modern American life under the control of an idiot ruler who lets people be misinformed by the media and a \"redneck agenda\". It gives different angles on an everyman, modern icons, and leaders. Released two months before U.S. President George W. Bush was reelected, the album became protest art. The album went on to sell 6 million copies in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album and was nominated in six other categories including Album of the Year. The album helped Green Day win seven of the eight awards it was nominated for at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards; the \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" video won six of those awards. A year later, \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. In 2009, Kerrang! named American Idiot the best album of the decade, NME ranked it number 60 in a similar list, and Rolling Stone ranked it 22nd. Rolling Stone also listed \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" and \"American Idiot\" among the 100 best songs of the 2000s, at number 65 and 47, respectively. In 2005, the album was ranked number 420 in Rock Hard magazine's book The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time. In 2012, the album was ranked number 225 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n",
      "While touring for American Idiot, the group filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD set called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band and showed how its members prepared to put on the show. The final shows of the 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, on December 14 and 17, respectively.On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. On January 10, 2006, the band was awarded People's Choice Award for favorite musical group or band.\n",

      "Green Day engaged in many other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. In 2008, the group released a garage-rock-inspired album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!! The Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini tour during the same year to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, California.\n",
      "In an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009.\n",

      "21st Century Breakdown was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. The album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. These were the group's first live shows in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continued around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010. The album won Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards on January 31, 2010. As of December 2010, 21st Century Breakdown has sold 1,005,000 copies in the US.Wal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, \"There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.\"In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot. American Idiot opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled \"When It's Time\". In June 2010 iTunes released \"When It's Time\" as a single.\n",
      "During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography.During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band members stated that they were writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: \"We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get [the songs] down in some early form.\" The band members also stated that the group was recording a live album of the tour, featuring the previously unreleased song \"Cigarettes and Valentines\". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that the group had completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album would \"most likely\" be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011.\n",

Green Day entered the studio and began recording new material in February 2012, later announcing a trilogy of albums titled ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! which would be released in fall 2012. The trilogy featured longtime touring guitarist Jason White joining the band in the studio as an additional musician. This marks the first time that White had played guitar on a Green Day album. That summer Green Day played several festivals and promotional shows including the Rock en Seine festival in France, the Rock am See festival in Germany, and the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom.\n",
      "¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! were released on September 21, November 9, and December 7, 2012, respectively, and were met with generally positive reviews from critics, though fans were more lukewarm towards the albums. On January 22, 2013, the band announced that ¡Cuatro!, a documentary about the making of ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! and ¡Tré!, would premiere on January 26 in Aspen, Colorado as part of the X Games FILM showcase, and would be released on DVD April 9, 2013. Another documentary was announced called Broadway Idiot which focuses on the creation on the American Idiot musical and Armstrong's run as playing the character of St. Jimmy. On March 10, 2013, Green Day began its 99 Revolutions Tour to support the trilogy. In June, Green Day broke Emirates Stadium attendance record with 60,000 tickets sold. The band played Dookie from start to finish on several dates on the tour's European leg, including during the Reading Festival 2013 headline show.Demolicious, a compilation album that contains alternate versions and demos of songs from ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! and ¡Tré! recorded during the studio sessions of these albums, was released on April 19, 2014, for Record Store Day.

In November 2016, the band performed at the American Music Awards in Los Angeles and made a political statement about the then-recent US election of Donald Trump by chanting \"No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA\" during their rendition of \"Bang Bang\".Aaron Burgess at Alternative Press observed, \"It's the first time in years Green Day haven't had all the answers. But as a statement on how it feels to fight, it's the closest to the truth they've ever gotten.\" Gwilym Mumford of The Guardian stated \"[after their last few albums] the band have decided to get back to basics: Revolution Radio is their most focused work in years. Lead single \"Bang Bang\" sets the tone, with a caustic consideration of the fame-hungry psychosis of a mass shooter.The band released their second greatest hits compilation, God's Favorite Band, on November 17, 2017. It contains 20 of their hits, along with two new tracks: a different version of the Revolution Radio track \"Ordinary World\", featuring country singer Miranda Lambert, and a previously unreleased song titled \"Back in the USA\".\n",

      "In November 2022, the band stated they were recording for a new studio album. The album was produced by Rob Cavallo, marking his first album working with the band since ¡Tré! (2012). Prior to the album's release, the band played a new song titled \"1981\" during their live performance at Festival d'été de Québec on July 16, 2023. On September 30, 2023, Green Day was announced as the halftime show at the 110th Grey Cup. The following day, the band launched a new website with the name \"The American Dream Is Killing Me\". Included on the website was a video appearing to tease new music, and a circled date of October 24, 2023, leading some news outlets to believe that it is related to their next album. Before the album's release, they played the first song, \"The American Dream Is Killing Me\", during a live show in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 19, 2023, and announced a US tour for the summer 2024 with the Smashing Pumpkins, Rancid, and the Linda Lindas.

      "== Musical style and influences ==\n",
      "Green Day's sound is often compared to first wave American and British punk rock bands such as the Ramones, Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Dickies, and Buzzcocks. Stylistically, several publications have characterized as punk rock, pop-punk, skate punk, melodic punk, alternative rock, and power pop. Critics have disputed the qualification of the band as power pop. The band has casually explored other musical styles including post-punk and pop-rock with 21st Century Breakdown, and garage rock on ¡Dos! and Father of All... Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Green Day as \"punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs.\" Among the labels of the band by critics, members Billie Joe Armstrong and Tre Cool have stated in interviews with Livewire and Kerrang! self-describing Green Day as just a punk rock band.While Armstrong is the band's primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal hardcore punk bands Hüsker Dü and the Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered Hüsker Dü's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a B-side to the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in the group's song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Southern California-based hardcore bands Social Distortion and Bad Religion have also been cited as influences. Green Day would cover the former's song \"Another State of Mind\" from their 1983 debut release, Mommy's Little Monster as a bonus track for 21st Century Breakdown.Outside of their punk influences, Green Day have also cited hard rock bands the Kinks, the Who, and Cheap Trick. In August 1996, Billie Joe Armstrong told Guitar World he \"can remember a few different instances\" of when he first discovered punk rock: \"There were these two guys who introduced me to things like D.O.A. and the Dead Kennedys. Then, in the seventh grade, there was a girl at school who would bring in records like T.S.O.L. and say, 'Here, listen to this.'\" Armstrong said he thinks he \"really started getting into\" punk rock \"in 1987 with Turn It Around!, a double seven-inch compilation record put out by [punk fanzine] Maximumrocknroll.\" Armstrong cited Turn It Around! as an influence, calling it \"a pretty big record\" for him. Armstrong would also cite fellow East Bay punk bands Operation Ivy, Jawbreaker, and Crimpshrine as influences. Tré Cool has stated that the band is influenced by music that they did not like, naming artists like Hall & Oates, Cyndi Lauper and other 1980s music.Although Green Day has been compared to the Buzzcocks, the Ramones and the Clash, Mike Dirnt said he had never heard the Buzzcocks when Green Day began. Dirnt said: \"First off, you can't sound like any of those bands. And secondly, those are probably the last ones in my record collection.\" Armstrong responded to Dirnt, saying: \"Mine too. Those are all bands I got into later.\" The Dickies is another band Green Day has been compared to. Dirnt said he \"never owned a Dickies album, although\" he \"did see\" the Dickies live \"around the time of\" Kerplunk!. Dirnt said \"by that time, we'd played so many shows it had no bearing.\" Armstrong referred to the Dickies as \"just another Ramones rip-off\". Although in August 1996, Armstrong said bands like the Ramones are bands he listened to later, in June 2010, Armstrong cited the Ramones as an influence. He also said his \"range of favorite songwriters goes anywhere from the Sex Pistols to Lennon–McCartney.\" During the American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown era of Green Day, the band was influenced by the Who, U2, Motown albums, and musicals such as Grease.Billie Joe Armstrong regularly invites musicians at Green Day concerts onstage to substitute for the band members on guitar, bass and drums, often letting the guest musicians keep the instruments they used during their guest spots. Armstrong explains, \"I remember being a kid and seeing Van Halen play. I was, like, 12, and Eddie would come out, and I'd go, 'God, it would be so cool to be up there and do what he's doing So I was always keeping that in mind, subconsciously that's basically what ended up happening, breaking down the barrier between the band and the audience.\"\n",

It was also listed in 100 greatest indie albums by Blender in 2007.Green Day is credited (alongside Bad Religion, the Offspring, NOFX, Social Distortion, and Rancid) with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States, particularly with the album Dookie, which was cited by Fuse as the most important pop-punk album of all time, the best alternative album of 1994 by Rolling Stone, and as one of the best punk rock albums of all time by Rolling Stone, Kerrang!, Revolver, and LA Weekly. It was also placed on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \"Definitive 200\" list of 200 classic albums. Both Dookie and American Idiot appeared on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2011, they were voted best punk rock band of all time by Rolling Stone. Diffuser.fm listed Dookie as the greatest album of the 90s.Green Day has sold roughly 75 million records worldwide as of 2024, making them one of the highest-selling artists of all time.

      "In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2015, their first year of eligibility.The band has been cited as an influence by a variety of artists, including Alkaline Trio, Avril Lavigne, AFI, Fall Out Boy, Blink-182, Joyce Manor, Lady Gaga, Wavves, Fidlar, Tegan and Sara, the Menzingers, New Found Glory, Prince Daddy & the Hyena, Bowling for Soup and Sum 41.\n",

      "Since 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day, starting other projects with various musicians. Notable projects related to Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder with Jason White and the Longshot with Jeff Matika, the Frustrators with Mike Dirnt, and the Network, a collaboration between Green Day and friends in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, which the band uses to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a family band called the Boo which recorded a one-off Christmas record for their friends and family making a few copies available in a local store. Since January 2018, Armstrong, Dirnt and White have played in the band the Coverups along with Green Day audio engineer Chris Dugan and tour manager Bill Schneider. The band sporadically performs one-off shows, usually in small clubs, and cover the songs of classic rock and alternative rock bands such as Cheap Trick, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Clash, and Nirvana.In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by the Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the disaster. In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil.Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008 but lost to the White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where the band performed a rock version of the show's theme song. Their version of it was released as a single on July 23, 2007.In 2009, the band collaborated with theater director Michael Mayer to adapt the group's rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past.\" Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that \"the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated\".Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be \"visually striking [and] musically adventurous\", but noted that \"the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development\". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's \"massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season\". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score \"is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered, [yet] there's enough variety. ... Where the show falls short is as a fully developed narrative.\" He concluded that \"American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, [it] deserves at least two cheers—for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway.\" Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote \"Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits—it's a global knockout.\" The musical has been nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for several Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards.\n",
      "In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by the group's manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that \"[Artists are] basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it.\" For Billie Joe Armstrong, \"Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.\"On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce. However, in February 2020, Billie Joe Armstrong revealed to NME that plans for a film adaptation of the stage musical had been \"pretty much scrapped\", without providing anymore details as to the reason.On January 23, 2013, it was announced that a documentary showing Armstrong's journey from punk rock to Broadway was to be released. Called Broadway Idiot and showing a lot of behind-the-scenes of the American Idiot musical production, the movie was directed by Doug Hamilton, veteran television journalist for CBS News' 60 Minutes and PBS documentaries such as Nova, Frontline and American Masters. A trailer was released on January 30, 2013. The documentary premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 15, 2013.Green Day served as executive producers of Turn It Around: The Story of East Bay Punk (2017), an extensive documentary film about the San Francisco Bay area punk scene from the late 1970s to the 1990s.\n",

      "Green Day has generated controversy over whether their musical style and major-label status constitutes \"true punk\". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former frontman of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented, \"So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.\" However, others in the punk rock scene would come to the defense of the band on their punk status. Bad Religion lead guitarist Brett Gurewitz and founder of the independent punk label Epitaph Records would state, \"They [Green Day] are a punk band, but you know, punk is the legacy of rock and roll, and Green Day are the biggest band in the genre.\"Armstrong has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying, \"Sometimes I think we've become redundant because we're this big band now; we've made a lot of money—we're not punk rock anymore. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'\" In 2021, Armstrong condemned the band's labeling as \"pop-punk\" by critics in a Vulture magazine interview, stating, \"I never really liked that term (pop punk), it turned into sort of a genre. I never thought of myself as a pop artist. I've always been left of center. To say you're a pop-punker … it never sat well with me.\" Armstrong acknowledged the band's more melodic punk style compared to other bands from the Bay Area scene it emerged from, but also brought up the band's performance alongside East Bay hardcore bands like Neurosis, Engage, Spitboy, Blatz, and Filth.In 2006, English rock musician Noel Gallagher of the Britpop band Oasis complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that the band had ripped off his song \"Wonderwall\" with \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\".\n",

      "=== 2012 iHeartRadio Festival incident ===\n",
      "On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was performing at the iHeartRadio music festival, Armstrong stopped while performing \"Basket Case\", because he believed the group's time was being shortened, possibly to extend R&B artist Usher's performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen in the rear of the audience was labeled \"1 Minutes Left\", saying \"You're gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!\" He also told the crowd he \"was not Justin Bieber\" and labeled the festival as a \"joke\". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage. Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident on the group's behalf stating that \"Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas\" also adding that Armstrong would be headed to rehab, for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills. However, Dirnt would later say in an interview with Rolling Stone that he agreed with what Armstrong meant by his rant. The band later made amends with the company and played an album release party for their 2016 release, Revolution Radio. They also returned to the festival in 2019 supporting the album Father of All Motherfuckers.\n",

      "On July 7, 2017, about 20 minutes before Green Day headlined Mad Cool, a festival in Madrid, an acrobat fell about 30 metres (98 ft) from a cage above the stage and died. Some fans were upset at the band and festival organizers for continuing the show, which was attended by about 35,000 people. On their website, Armstrong said the band did not know about the accident before their set, and likely would not have played if they had.\n",

      "Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem, is an American rapper. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is often regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. His global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as an influence by and upon many artists working in various genres.\n",
      "After the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus in 2005, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry four years later with the release of Relapse (2009) and Recovery, which was released the following year. Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide of 2010, making it Eminem's second album, after The Eminem Show in 2002, to be the best-selling album of the year worldwide. In the following years, he released the US number one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018), and Music to Be Murdered By (2020).\n",
      "Eminem's best-known songs include \"My Name Is\", \"The Real Slim Shady\", \"The Way I Am\", \"Stan\", \"Without Me\", \"Lose Yourself\", \"Mockingbird\", \"Not Afraid\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", \"Rap God\", \"The Monster\", \"River\" and \"Godzilla\". In addition to his solo career, Eminem was a member of the hip hop group D12. He is also known for collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9\"; the two are collectively known as Bad Meets Evil.\n",
      "Eminem starred in the 2002 musical drama film 8 Mile, playing a dramatized version of himself. \"Lose Yourself\", a track from its soundtrack, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeks, the most for a solo rap song, and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making Eminem the first hip hop artist ever to win the award. He has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009), and The Interview (2014), and the television series Entourage (2010). Eminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records, a joint venture with manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch the careers of artists such as 50 Cent, D12, and Obie Trice, among others. He has also established his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio.\n",
      "Eminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States of the 2000s and the bestselling male music artist in the United States of the 2010s, third overall. Billboard named him the \"Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)\". He has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200—which all consecutively debuted at number one on the chart, making him the first artist to achieve this—and five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits (2005), \"Lose Yourself\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", and \"Not Afraid\" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Rolling Stone has included him in its lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. In November 2022, Eminem was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n",

      "== Early life ==\n",
      "Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah Rae \"Debbie\" (née Nelson). He is of Scottish, Welsh, English, Cherokee, German, Swiss, Polish, and possibly Luxembourgish ancestry. \n",
      "His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him. Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before they separated. His father abandoned his family when Eminem was a year and a half old, and he was raised only by his mother, Debbie, in poverty. His mother later had a son named Nathan \"Nate\" Kane Samara.  At age twelve, he and his mother had moved several times and lived in several towns and cities in Missouri (including St. Joseph, Savannah, and Kansas City) before settling in Warren, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Eminem frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as having a \"very suspicious, almost paranoid personality\". He wrote letters to his father, but Debbie said that they all came back marked \"return to sender\".\n",
      "When he was a child, a bully named D'Angelo Bailey severely injured Eminem's head in an assault, an incident which Eminem later recounted (with comic exaggeration) on the song \"Brain Damage\". Debbie filed a lawsuit against the public school for this in 1982. The suit was dismissed the following year by a Macomb County, Michigan judge, who said the schools were immune from lawsuits. For much of his youth, Eminem and his mother lived in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood. He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths.Eminem was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic book artist before discovering hip hop. He heard his first rap song (\"Reckless\", featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother Ronnie Polkingharn. His uncle was close to the boy and later became a musical mentor to him. When Polkingharn committed suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking publicly for days and did not attend his funeral.At age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names \"Manix\" and \"M&M\", the latter evolving into \"Eminem\". Eminem snuck into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles. On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road, considered \"ground zero\" for the Detroit rap scene. Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip hop audiences. When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne \"Kim\" Scott to stay at their home. Several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott. After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades, he dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17. Although interested in English, Eminem never explored literature (preferring comic books) and he disliked math and social studies. Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills. One of the jobs he had was with Little Caesar's Pizza in Warren, Michigan. He later said she often threw him out of the house anyway, often after taking most of his paycheck. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.\n",

      "=== 1988–1997: Early career, Infinite and family struggles ===\n",
      "In 1988, he went by the stage name MC Double M and formed his first group New Jacks and made a self-titled demo tape with DJ Butter Fingers. In 1989, they later joined Bassmint Productions who later changed their name to Soul Intent in 1992 with rapper Proof and other childhood friends. They released a self-titled EP in 1995 featuring Proof. Eminem also made his first music video appearance in 1992 in a song titled, \"Do-Da-Dippity\", by Champtown. Later in 1996, Eminem and Proof teamed up with four other rappers to form The Dirty Dozen (D12), who released The Underground E.P. in 1997 and their first album Devil's Night in 2001. He was also affiliated with Newark's rap collective Outsidaz, collaborating with them on different projects.\n",
      "Eminem was soon signed to Jeff and Mark Bass's F.B.T. Productions and recorded his debut album Infinite for their independent Web Entertainment label. The album was a commercial failure upon its release in 1996. One lyrical subject of Infinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, on little money. During this period, Eminem's rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers Nas, Esham and AZ, lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known. Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored Infinite and the feedback Eminem did receive (\"Why don't you go into rock and roll?\") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks.At this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood and their house was robbed several times. Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilbert's Lodge, a family-style restaurant at St. Clair Shores. His former boss described him as becoming a model employee, as he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailie's birth. He was fired shortly before Christmas and later said, \"It was, like, five days before Christmas, which is Hailie's birthday. I had, like, forty dollars to get her something.\" After the release of Infinite, his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt. By March 1997 he was fired from Gilbert's Lodge for the last time and lived in his mother's mobile home with Kim and Hailie.\n",

      "=== 1997–1999: Introduction of Slim Shady, The Slim Shady LP and rise to success ===\n",
      "Eminem attracted more attention when he developed Slim Shady, a sadistic, violent alter ego. The character allowed him to express his anger with lyrics about drugs, rape and murder. In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP, the Slim Shady EP, which was released that winter by Web Entertainment. The EP, with frequent references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability and violence, also explored the more-serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct, self-deprecating response to criticism. Hip hop magazine The Source featured Eminem in its \"Unsigned Hype\" column in March 1998.After he was fired from his job and evicted from his home, Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics, an annual, nationwide battle rap competition. He placed second and an Interscope Records intern named Dean Geistlinger was in attendance and asked Eminem for a copy of the Slim Shady EP, which was then sent to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment and founding member of hip hop group N.W.A. Dre recalled, \"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'\" He would later state on the fourth and last episode of The Defiant Ones, \"I was like: what the fuck!?, and who the fuck is that?\" expressing his shock towards Mathers' rapping talent. Although his associates criticized him for hiring a white rapper, he was confident in his decision: \"I don't give a fuck if you're purple; if you can kick it, I'm working with you.\" Eminem had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A as a teenager and was nervous about working with him on an album: \"I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars let alone Dr. Dre.\" He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions.Eminem released The Slim Shady LP in February 1999. Although it was one of the year's most popular albums (certified triple platinum by the end of the year), he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper Cage. The album's popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics; in \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wife's body and in \"Guilty Conscience\" which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover. \"Guilty Conscience\" marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The label-mates later collaborated on a number of hit songs (\"Forgot About Dre\" and \"What's the Difference\" while also providing uncredited vocals on \"The Watcher\" from Dr. Dre's album 2001, \"Bitch Please II\" from The Marshall Mathers LP, \"Say What You Say\" from The Eminem Show, \"Encore/Curtains Down\" from Encore and \"Old Time's Sake\" and \"Crack a Bottle\" from Relapse) and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminem's Aftermath albums. The Slim Shady LP has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.\n",

      "\n",
      "=== 1999–2003: The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show ===\n",
      "After Eminem released The Slim Shady LP, he started his own record label, Shady Records, in late 1999. Eminem looked for an avenue to release D12, and his manager Paul Rosenberg was keen to start a label, which led to the two teaming up to form Shady. Its A&R Marc Labelle has defined the record label as \"a boutique label but [with] all the outlets of a major [and] Interscope backing up our every move.\"Recorded from 1999 to 2000, The Marshall Mathers LP was released in May 2000. It sold 1.76 million copies in its first week, breaking US records held by Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle for fastest-selling hip hop album and Britney Spears' ...Baby One More Time for fastest-selling solo album. The first single from the album, \"The Real Slim Shady\", was a success despite controversies about Eminem's insults and dubious claims about celebrities (for example, that Christina Aguilera had performed oral sex on Carson Daly and Fred Durst). In his second single, \"The Way I Am\", he reveals the pressure from his record company to top \"My Name Is\". Although Eminem parodied shock rocker Marilyn Manson in the music video for \"My Name Is\", they are reportedly on good terms; Manson is mentioned in \"The Way I Am\", appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem. In the third single, \"Stan\" (which samples Dido's \"Thank You\"), Eminem tries to deal with his new fame, assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend (mirroring \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" from The Slim Shady LP).The music magazine Q called \"Stan\" the third-greatest rap song ever, and it was ranked tenth in a Top40-Charts.com survey. The song has since been ranked 296th on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list. In July 2000, Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of The Source. The Marshall Mathers LP was certified Diamond by the RIAA in March 2011 and sold 21 million copies worldwide.In 2000 Eminem also appeared in the Up in Smoke Tour with rappers Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Ice Cube and the Family Values Tour with Limp Bizkit, headlining the Anger Management Tour with Papa Roach, Ludacris and Xzibit. Eminem performed with Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony in 2001, with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD, an organization which considered Eminem's lyrics homophobic) condemning John's decision to perform with Eminem. Entertainment Weekly placed the appearance on its end-of-decade \"best-of\" list: \"It was the hug heard 'round the world. Eminem, under fire for homophobic lyrics, shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of 'Stan' that would have been memorable in any context.\" On February 21, the day of the awards ceremony, GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center (the ceremony's venue). Eminem was also the only guest artist to appear on fellow rapper Jay-Z's critically acclaimed album The Blueprint, producing and rapping on the song \"Renegade\".The Eminem Show was released in May 2002. It was another success, reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1.332 million copies during its first full week. The album's single, \"Without Me\", denigrates boy bands, Limp Bizkit, Dick and Lynne Cheney, Moby and others. The Eminem Show, certified Diamond by the RIAA, examines the effects of Eminem's rise to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip hop community, addressing an assault charge brought by a bouncer he saw kissing his wife in 2000. Although several tracks are clearly angry, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found The Eminem Show less inflammatory than The Marshall Mathers LP. L. Brent Bozell III, who had criticized The Marshall Mathers LP for misogynistic lyrics, noted The Eminem Show's extensive use of obscenity and called Eminem \"Eminef\" for the prevalence of the word \"motherfucker\" on the album. The Eminem Show sold 27 million copies worldwide and was the bestselling album of 2002.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 2003–2007: Production work, Encore and musical hiatus ===\n",
      "In 2003, Eminem, a lifelong fan of Tupac, provided production work for three tracks on the Tupac Resurrection soundtrack. He would follow this up the next year by producing 12 of the 16 tracks on Tupac's Loyal to the Game album. On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service said that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States. The cause for concern was the lyrics of \"We As Americans\" (\"Fuck money / I don't rap for dead presidents / I'd rather see the president dead / It's never been said, but I set precedents\"), which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of Encore.Encore, released in 2004, was another success, but not as successful as his previous albums. Its sales were partially driven by the first single, \"Just Lose It\", which contained slurs directed toward Michael Jackson. On October 12, 2004, a week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson phoned Steve Harvey's radio show, The Steve Harvey Morning Show, to report his displeasure with its video (which parodies Jackson's child molestation trial, plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when Jackson's hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial). In the song, Eminem says, \"That's not a stab at Michael / That's just a metaphor / I'm just psycho.\" Many of Jackson's friends and supporters spoke out against the video, including Stevie Wonder, who described it as \"kicking a man while he's down\" and \"bullshit\", and Steve Harvey (who said, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back\"). The video also parodied Pee-wee Herman, MC Hammer and Madonna during her Blond Ambition period. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who parodied the Eminem song \"Lose Yourself\" on \"Couch Potato\" for his 2003 album Poodle Hat, told the Chicago Sun-Times about Jackson's protest: \"Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my 'Lose Yourself' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me.\" Although Black Entertainment Television stopped playing the video, MTV announced that it would continue to air it. The Source, through CEO Raymond \"Benzino\" Scott, called for the video to be pulled, the song removed from the album and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson. In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music from Viacom, giving him the rights to songs by Eminem, Shakira, Beck and others.Despite its lead single's humorous theme, Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song \"Mosh\", which criticized President George W. Bush as \"This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president\", with lyrics including \"Fuck Bush.\" On October 25, 2004, a week before the 2004 US Presidential election, Eminem released the video for \"Mosh\" on the Internet. In it, Eminem gathers an army (including rapper Lloyd Banks) of Bush-administration victims and leads them to the White House. When they break in, it is learned that they are there to register to vote; the video ends with \"VOTE Tuesday November 2.\" After Bush's reelection, the video's ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the White House during a speech by the president. Also in 2004 Eminem launched a satellite music channel, Shade 45, on Sirius radio, which was described by his manager as \"essentially a destination to get and hear things that other people aren't playing.\"Eminem began his first US concert tour in three years in the summer of 2005 with the Anger Management 3 Tour, featuring 50 Cent, G-Unit, Lil Jon, D12, Obie Trice and the Alchemist, but in August he canceled the European leg of the tour, later announcing that he had entered drug rehabilitation for treatment of a \"dependency on sleep medication\". Meanwhile, industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering retirement, while rumors circulated that a double album titled The Funeral would be released. In July, the Detroit Free Press reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive. A greatest hits album, Curtain Call: The Hits, was released on December 6, 2005, by Aftermath Entertainment, and sold nearly 441,000 copies in the US in its first week, marking Eminem's fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard Hot 200, and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. However, Eminem suggested that month on WKQI's \"Mojo in the Morning\" show that he would be taking a break as an artist: \"I'm at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don't know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it 'Curtain Call' because this could be the final thing. We don't know.\"\n",
      "In April 2006, Proof, who was Eminem's childhood friend, was murdered. Eight months later, Eminem released a compilation album titled Eminem Presents: The Re-Up that featured Proof and other Shady Records artists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 2007–2009: Comeback and Relapse ===\n",
      "In September 2007, Eminem called New York radio station WQHT during an interview with 50 Cent, saying that he was \"in limbo\" and \"debating\" about when (or if) he would release another album: \"I'm always working – I'm always in the studio. It feels good right now, the energy of the label. For a while, I didn't want to go back to the studio ... I went through some personal things. I'm coming out of those personal things [and] it feels good.\"Eminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008, saying: \"Right now I'm kinda just concentrating on my own stuff, for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff. You know, the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get 'cause I just start knowing stuff.\" Interscope confirmed that a new album would be released in spring 2009. In December 2008, Eminem provided more details about the album, entitled Relapse: \"Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days, man. Dre will end up producing the majority of the tracks on 'Relapse'. We are up to our old mischievous ways ... let's just leave it at that.\"According to a March 5, 2009, press release, Eminem would release two new albums that year. Relapse, the first, was released on May 19; its first single and music video, \"We Made You\", had been released on April 7. Although Relapse did not sell as well as Eminem's previous albums and received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success and re-established his presence in the hip hop world. It sold more than five million copies worldwide. On October 30 he headlined at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, his first full performance of the year. Eminem's act included several songs from Relapse, many of his older hits and an appearance by D12. On November 19, he announced on his website that Relapse: Refill would be released on December 21. The album was a re-release of Relapse with seven bonus tracks, including \"Forever\" and \"Taking My Ball\". Eminem described the CD:\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned ... Hopefully, these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year ... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers, including Just Blaze, and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch. The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2, but I still want the other stuff to be heard.\n",

      "=== 2009–2011: Recovery and Bad Meets Evil reunion ===\n",
      "On April 14, 2010, Eminem tweeted: \"There is no Relapse 2\". Although his followers thought he was not releasing an album, he had changed its title to Recovery and confirmed this by tweeting \"Recovery\" with a link to his website. He said:\n",
      "\n",
      "I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title.\n",
      "Recorded from 2009 to 2010, Recovery was released on June 18. In the US, Recovery sold 741,000 copies during its first week, topping the Billboard 200 chart. Eminem's sixth consecutive US number-one album also topped the charts in several other countries. Recovery remained atop the Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks of a seven-week total.Billboard reported that it was the bestselling album of 2010, making Eminem the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history with two year-end bestselling albums. Recovery is the bestselling digital album in history. Its first single, \"Not Afraid\", was released on April 29 and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100; its music video was released on June 4. \"Not Afraid\" was followed by \"Love the Way You Lie\", which debuted at number two before rising to the top. Although \"Love the Way You Lie\" was the bestselling 2010 single in the United Kingdom, it did not reach number one (the first time this has happened in the UK since 1969). Despite criticism of its inconsistency, Recovery received positive reviews from most critics. As of November 21, 2010, the album had US sales of three million copies. Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide in 2010, joining 2002's bestseller The Eminem Show to give Eminem two worldwide year-end number-one albums. With Recovery, Eminem broke the record for the most successive US number-one albums by a solo artist.He appeared at the 2010 BET Awards, performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Airplanes, Part II\" with B.o.B and Keyshia Cole. Later that year, he performed at the Activison E3 concert. In June, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in Detroit and New York City, at concerts called The Home & Home Tour.

He opened the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, performing \"Not Afraid\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Rihanna singing the choruses. Due to the success of Recovery and the Home & Home Tour, Eminem was named the 2010 Hottest MC in the Game by MTV and Emcee of the Year by the online magazine HipHopDX. He and Rihanna again collaborated on \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\", the sequel of their hit single. Unlike the original, Rihanna is the lead vocalist and it is sung from the female perspective.

In the song, Eminem calls the newly elected President Donald Trump a \"bitch\" and also raps about raping conservative social and political commentator Ann Coulter, who is a Trump supporter, with a variety of foreign objects. Coulter responded to the lyrics, stating, \"I think it's unfortunate that the left, from Berkeley to Eminem with his rap songs, has normalized violence against women, as Eminem has done.\" Eminem participated in the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards' annual cypher, using his verse, a freestyle rap called \"The Storm\", to further criticize Trump and the administration for, among other things, Trump's focus on National Football League players' protests during \"The Star Spangled Banner\" over Hurricane Maria recovery efforts and lack of gun control reform in the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting.

      "Eminem has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, including Esham, Kool G Rap, Masta Ace, Big Daddy Kane, Tupac Shakur, Newcleus, Ice-T, Mantronix, Melle Mel (on \"The Message\"), LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Run-D.M.C., Rakim and Boogie Down Productions.\n",
      "In How to Rap, Guerilla Black notes that Eminem studied other MCs to hone his rapping technique: \"Eminem listened to everything and that's what made him one of the greats\". In the book, other MCs also praise aspects of his rapping technique: varied, humorous subject matter, connecting with his audience, carrying a concept over a series of albums, complex rhyme schemes, bending words so they rhyme, multisyllabic rhymes, many rhymes to a bar, complex rhythms, clear enunciation, and the use of melody and syncopation. Eminem is known to write most of his lyrics on paper (documented in The Way I Am), taking several days or a week to craft lyrics, being a \"workaholic\" and \"stacking\" vocals. Examples of hip hop subgenres that Eminem's music has been described as include horrorcore, comedy hip hop, and hardcore hip hop. Eminem also incorporates rap rock into his music and has cited rock acts during the 1970s and 1980s, such as Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, as influences in his music.\n",

      "=== Alter egos ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Eminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter. His best-known alter ego, Slim Shady, first appeared on the Slim Shady EP and was in The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Encore, Relapse, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, Kamikaze and Music to Be Murdered By. In this persona, his songs are violent and dark, with a comic twist. Eminem downplayed Slim Shady on Recovery because he felt it did not fit the album's theme. Another character is Ken Kaniff, a gay man who pokes fun at Eminem's songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on the Slim Shady LP, where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album's release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on Marshall Mathers and later albums (except Encore and Recovery). Aristotle, angry with Eminem's use of his character, released a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing him.\n",

      "\n",
      "Although Eminem usually collaborates with Aftermath Entertainment and Shady Records rappers such as Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Obie Trice and Yelawolf, he has also worked with Redman, Kid Rock, DMX, Lil Wayne, Missy Elliott, Jay Z, Drake, Rihanna, Nas, Nicki Minaj, Xzibit, Method Man, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Sticky Fingaz, T.I. and Young Jeezy. Eminem rapped a verse in a live performance of Busta Rhymes' \"Touch It\" remix at the 2006 BET Music Awards. He appeared on Akon's single \"Smack That\" from Konvicted, Lil Wayne's hit \"Drop the World\" and \"My Life\" (the lead single from 50 Cent's Street King Immortal).\n",
      "Eminem was the executive producer of D12's first two albums (Devil's Night and D12 World), Obie Trice's Cheers and Second Round's on Me and 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin' and The Massacre. He has produced songs for other rappers such as Jadakiss' \"Welcome To D-Block\", Jay-Z's \"Renegade\" and \"Moment of Clarity\", Lloyd Banks' \"On Fire\", \"Warrior Part 2\" and \"Hands Up\", Tony Yayo's \"Drama Setter\", Trick-Trick's \"Welcome 2 Detroit\" and Xzibit's \"My Name\" and \"Don't Approach Me\". Most of The Eminem Show was produced by Eminem and his longtime collaborator, Jeff Bass, and Eminem co-produced Encore with Dr. Dre. In 2004, Eminem was co-executive producer of 2Pac's posthumous album Loyal to the Game with Shakur's mother, Afeni. He produced the UK number-one single \"Ghetto Gospel\", featuring Elton John; \"The Cross\", from the Nas album God's Son; and eight tracks on Obie Trice's 2006 album Second Round's on Me (also appearing on \"There They Go\"). Eminem produced several tracks on Trick-Trick's The Villain (appearing on \"Who Want It\") and produced four tracks on Cashis' 2013 album The County Hound 2.\n",
      "Eminem has only produced for and appeared on one track with former Aftermath/Interscope labelmate The Game; \"We Ain't\" (a track from Game's January 2005 debut album, The Documentary). In 2022, Game would later release a ten-minute diss track towards Eminem titled \"The Black Slim Shady\".Eminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics, rather than writing to beats. One exception was \"Stan\", which came from an idea and scratch track produced by the 45 King. After doing little production on Relapse and Recovery, Eminem produced a significant portion of The Marshall Mathers LP 2. He said about producing his own music, \"Sometimes, I may get something in my head, like an idea or the mood of something that I would want, and I'm not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made. They don't know what's in my head. I think maybe it helps, a little bit, with diversity, the sound of it, but also, I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch.\" In 1998 when his beef with rapper Cage was still happening, New York rapper Necro (who had previously produced three songs for Cage) met Eminem and gave him a CD with the beat to what eventually became the beat for the song \"Black Helicopters\" by rap group Non-Phixion. Despite Eminem never using it, Necro still said positive things about Eminem and would appear on Shade45 years later.\n",

Eminem signed his Detroit collective, D12 and rapper Obie Trice to the label and signed 50 Cent in a 2002 joint venture with Dr. Dre's Aftermath label. In 2003, Eminem and Dr. Dre added Atlanta rapper Stat Quo to the Shady-Aftermath roster. DJ Green Lantern, Eminem's former DJ, was with Shady Records until a dispute related to the 50 Cent-Jadakiss feud forced him to leave the label. The Alchemist is currently Eminem's tour DJ. In 2005 Eminem signed another Atlanta rapper, Bobby Creekwater and West Coast rapper Cashis to Shady Records.On December 5, 2006, the compilation album Eminem Presents: The Re-Up was released on Shady Records. The project began as a mixtape, but when Eminem found the material better than expected he released it as an album. The Re-Up was intended to introduce Stat Quo, Cashis and Bobby Creekwater. While he was recording Infinite, Eminem, Proof and Kon Artis assembled a group of fellow rappers now known as D12, short for \"Detroit Twelve\" or \"Dirty Dozen\", who performed in a style similar to Wu-Tang Clan. In 2001 D12's debut album, Devil's Night, was released. The first single from the album was \"Shit on You\", followed by \"Purple Pills\" (an ode to recreational drug use) and \"Fight Music\". \"Purple Pills\" was rewritten for radio and television, removing many of the song's references to drugs and sex and renamed \"Purple Hills\".\n",
      "After their debut, D12 took a three-year break from the studio. They reunited in 2004 for their second album, D12 World, which included the hit singles \"My Band\" and \"How Come\". \"American Psycho 2\" featuring Cypress Hill member, B-Real, was another popular hit. According to D12 member Bizarre, Eminem was not featured on his album Blue Cheese & Coney Island because \"he's busy doing his thing\".In January 2014, Bass Brothers announced that D12 had returned to record at F.B.T. Studio and they were working on an album with Eminem on at least three songs. Bizarre reported that he was still part of the group and that the album was scheduled for a 2014 release.\n",

      "After small roles in the 2001 film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for \"Got the Life\" (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the semi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including \"Lose Yourself\" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running No. 1 hip hop single in history). Eminem was absent from the ceremony and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.Eminem voiced an aging, corrupt, Ebonics-speaking police officer in the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun – Will Travel, and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper. Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People. In a 2010 interview with Jonathan Ross, he stated \"You know, I love music so much. This is my passion, this is what I want to do. Not saying that I won't do a movie ever again, but this is me.\"He played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale \"Lose Yourself\" with Christina Aguilera. Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit. Eminem had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film The Interview. During an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem satirically comes out as gay.\n",

Scott and her twin sister had run away from home; they moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15 and he began an on-and-off relationship with Scott in 1989.\n",
      "Mathers and Scott were married in 1999 and divorced in 2001. Although Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2002, \"I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again\", he and Scott briefly remarried in January 2006. He filed for divorce in early April, agreeing to joint custody of Hailie. Their daughter, Hailie Jade is a social media influencer, specifically for fashion and beauty.Eminem legally adopted and was given custody of his sister-in-law's daughter, as well as Scott's child from an affair. He also raised his younger half-brother Nathan.Eminem and actress Brittany Murphy dated in the 2000s. He stated in 2002 that he had been dating singer Mariah Carey, though she later denied it. In 2005, he played alleged voicemails of her during the Anger Management Tour and stated in 2006 that he had dated her for six to seven months, but the two broke up due to the differences in their personalities.In early 2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Scott had renewed their romantic relationship; however, in the same statement, his representative also confirmed that they now maintain a friendly relationship.In his 2013 song \"Headlights\", Eminem reiterated his love for his mother and apologized to her for some of the lyrics from his songs, with \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" being specifically named.\n",

      "=== Health problems ===\n",
      "Eminem has spoken publicly about his addiction to prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Ambien and Valium. According to friend and fellow D12 member Proof, Eminem first straightened out in 2002. During the production of 8 Mile, Eminem, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia. An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \"knocked [him] out\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on Encore, he would \"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \"feel normal\", taking a \"ridiculous amount ... I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30.\" The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem's weight increased to 230 pounds (100 kg) and he was regularly eating fast food: \"The kids behind the counter knew me — it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad.\" Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: \"Eminem ain't fat\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a methadone overdose. He had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was \"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\". He continued to buy more until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of heroin and was \"about two hours from dying\". After missing Christmas with his children, Hailie, Alaina and Stevie, Eminem checked himself out of the facility, weak and not fully detoxed. He tore the meniscus in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a seizure. His drug use \"ramped right back to where it was before\" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program that emphasized running. Elton John was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a week to check on him. Eminem has been sober since April 20, 2008.\n",

      "In April 2020, Matthew David Hughes, a 26-year-old homeless man, broke into Eminem's house in Clinton Township, Macomb County, Michigan, breaking a kitchen window with a brick paver. Eminem woke up with Hughes standing behind him and he said that he was there to kill him. In a plea agreement in 2021, Hughes pleaded guilty to second-degree home invasion in exchange for dismissal of other charges; he was sentenced to probation and time served (524 days in the county jail). In 2019, Hughes had pleaded guilty to breaking into a Rochester Hills home in search of Eminem.On August 30, 2023, it was revealed that the perpetrator of the 2023 Jacksonville shooting Ryan Palmeter targeted Eminem and Machine Gun Kelly as his victims in a racially-motivated attack.\n",

      "=== Politics ===\n",
      "In multiple songs, Eminem has expressed political views that align with the Democratic Party; however, he has refrained from direct endorsements of politicians, focusing more on criticisms instead. The first was \"Mosh\", which was released in 2004, a few weeks before the 2004 United States presidential election, and heavily criticized then-president George W. Bush but did not directly endorse John Kerry either. He would not express political views again until the 2016 United States presidential election when he released \"Campaign Speech\", which criticized presidential candidate Donald Trump. The following year, he criticized Trump in a freestyle titled \"The Storm\". In the freestyle, he expressed support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and the U.S. national anthem protests, and expressed his displeasure for any of his fans that support Trump. In his song \"Darkness\", he heavily references the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, and at the end of the music video expresses his support for gun control. The week before the 2020 United States presidential election, he approved his song \"Lose Yourself\" to be used in a campaign video for Joe Biden. After the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Eminem posted a tweet to his Twitter expressing his displeasure for the decision saying \"As a father it pisses me off that women have fewer rights 2day than just a few days ago… we r fuckin goin bckwards. Here's how 2 help in Michigan. [sic]\" and included a link to a pro-choice organization in Michigan. In 2023, he requested that Republican election candidate Vivek Ramaswamy stop rapping his song \"Lose Yourself\" at campaign rallies, sending Ramaswamy a cease and desist letter.\n",

      "=== Insane Clown Posse ===\n",
      "The feud with fellow Detroit hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse began in 1997, when Eminem was throwing a party to promote his debut EP, Slim Shady EP. He gave Joseph Bruce (aka Violent J from Insane Clown Posse) a flyer which stated \"Featuring appearances by Esham, Kid Rock, and ICP (maybe)\". Bruce asked why Eminem was promoting a possible Insane Clown Posse appearance without first contacting the group. Eminem explained, \"It says 'maybe.' Maybe you will be there; I don't know. That's why I'm asking you right now. You guys comin' to my release party, or what?\" Bruce, upset over not being consulted, responded, \"Fuck no, I ain't coming to your party. We might have, if you would've asked us first, before putting us on the fuckin' flyer like this.\"Eminem took Bruce's response as a personal offense, subsequently attacking the group in radio interviews. Bruce and Utsler responded with a parody of Eminem's \"My Name Is\" entitled \"Slim Anus\" and other tracks including \"Nuttin' But a Bitch Thang\" and \"Please Don't Hate Me\". Eminem insulted Insane Clown Posse on various tracks from his album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000), including \"Marshall Mathers\" and \"Ken Kaniff\". In 2002, Eminem briefly dissed them on his single \"Business\" from The Eminem Show.\n",
      "Insane Clown Posse talked about the feud being squashed in an interview with MTV, saying that Proof squashed the conflict in 2005, which was followed by a bowling game between members of D12 and Psychopathic Records. Violent J stated that, \"He contacted us and we had a bowling game – it was really cool. We're something different. They could have skipped over us and said forget them, but they included us and said let's squash it.\"\n",

      "=== Everlast and Limp Bizkit ===\n",
      "In the early 2000s, Eminem was notified while on the Anger Management Tour that former House Of Pain member Everlast had mocked him on a song. Everlast claimed that while passing by Mathers in a hotel lobby, Mathers gave him a \"weird look\". Everlast's verse from the Dilated Peoples all star track \"Ear Drums Pop (Remix)\" contained a thinly veiled reference to Eminem (\"Cock my hammer, spit a comet like Haley/I buck a .380 on ones that act shady\") and went on to warn \"You might catch a beatdown out where I come from\" in his recounting of the incident. Taking offense to this, Eminem and D12 quickly began work on a retaliatory song, \"I Remember\", which ripped Everlast several times in public and with the song.\n",
      "Eminem and his group D12 responded with \"Quitter\", the second half of which is a take off on 2Pac's iconic disstrack \"Hit 'Em Up\" (a diss song aimed at The Notorious B.I.G.). The track ends with the spoken words, \"Fuck him, that's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done, that's it.\" \n",
      "It was reported that long-time friends of Eminem, nu metal group Limp Bizkit, were meant to be featured on the song, but lead singer Fred Durst canceled at the last moment. The record continued to be released without the group, causing the Everlast-Mathers dispute to continue. In a TRL interview, Limp Bizkit member DJ Lethal, made a statement that if Mathers and Everlast were to fight in real life, Everlast would win. This would lead to an insulting track aimed at both Everlast and Limp Bizkit (namely Durst and Lethal) appearing on D12's 2001 mainstream debut album, Devil's Night, as the track \"Girls\". \n",
      "Recently, things seem to have settled and Eminem has no longer been heard insulting Everlast or Limp Bizkit. It is currently unknown if the dispute is resolved. During Eminem's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech in 2022, he credited House of Pain as an influence.\n",

      "=== Canibus ===\n",
      "The animus with rapper Canibus started when he and Haitian musician Wyclef Jean confronted Eminem and asked him if he had ghost-wrote the track \"The Ripper Strikes Back\" by LL Cool J. Eminem denied that he wrote the track. After he was confronted, he said Canibus was \"rude\" to him.Two years later, Canibus went to see Eminem on the Warped Tour and apologized to him for his reactions and asked him if he still wanted the track. Eminem agreed, but when he heard the track \"Phuck U\" from Canibus' album 2000 B.C., he thought the track was directed at him and LL Cool J. Shortly afterwards, Eminem released his third album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and Canibus decided to continue the \"story\" of Eminem's single \"Stan\". He titled the track \"U Didn't Care\" and it continued to take shots at Eminem. Eminem decided to take more shots at Canibus on his album The Eminem Show (2002) on tracks such as \"Say What You Say\", \"When The Music Stops\" and \"Square Dance\". Even though Canibus did not immediately respond to the tracks, Eminem continued to take shots at him, including \"My Name\", a track that Eminem was featured on  Xzibit's album Man vs. Machine (2002). \n",
      "On November 19, 2002, Canibus responded with the track titled \"Dr.‍C PhD\". Over a year later Eminem released the track \"Can-I-Bitch\". He attacked Canibus in a humorous matter. Since then the hostilities have cooled down, but Canibus tried to provoke a reignition of it when he leaked a track titled \"Air Strike (Pop Killer)\", that featured vocal parts of D12, where Canibus takes shots at Eminem and his deceased friend Proof. D12 member Swift responded to the record publicly and had the following to say about DZK (another rapper featured on the track). \"[He] asked us to do a track with him when he already was teamed up with Canibus without us knowing. They dissed Em, took our verses, and added them to the song, so they can bring traffic and make it seem like we were turning on Em [...] as a desperate attempt to be heard after ducking and dodging Em for 7 years. It was a straight hoe move.\"\n",

      "The 2004 music video for \"Just Lose It\" generated controversy by parodying pop icon Michael Jackson's child molestation trial, plastic surgery and an incident in which Jackson's hair caught on fire while filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984. It was banned on the BET channel, after complaints from Benzino and others (but was later reinstated, as critics of the ban argued that Nelly's \"Tip Drill\" video could be seen). Both were only seen on BET: Uncut. However, MTV did not drop it, and the video became one of the most requested on the channel. A week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson called in to the radio show of Steve Harvey to report his displeasure with the video. \"I am very angry at Eminem's depiction of me in his video\", Jackson said in the interview. \"I feel that it is outrageous and disrespectful. It is one thing to spoof, but it is another to be demeaning and insensitive.\" The singer continued: \"I've admired Eminem as an artist, and was shocked by this. The video was inappropriate and disrespectful to me, my children, my family and the community at large.\" Many of Jackson's supporters and friends spoke out about the video, including Stevie Wonder, who called the video \"kicking a man while he's down\" and \"bullshit\", and Steve Harvey, who declared, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back.\"\n",

      "On November 19, Ja Rule and Irv Gotti were special guests on Star and Bucwild's morning show on Hot 97 NYC. Gotti claimed to have \"legal documents\" referring to an order of protection 50 Cent \"has on him\". Ja Rule threatened, that if 50 Cent released any diss track, he would take action towards his two producers.\n",
      "However, Dr. Dre was the one who produced 50 Cent's track \"Back Down\" in 2003 from the album Get Rich Or Die Tryin', which included lyrics insulting not only Murder Inc., but also Ja Rule's family; in the song, he raps, \"Your Mami, your Papi, that bitch you chasin' your lil dirty ass kids, I'll fuckin' erase them.\"Fellow rapper Busta Rhymes decided to join the conflict when he was featured on the track \"Hail Mary 2003\", with Eminem and 50 Cent.\n",
      "The feud intensified when Ja Rule released a diss called \"Loose Change\", in which he took shots at 50 Cent as well as Eminem (calling him \"Feminem\") and Dr. Dre (accuse him of being \"bisexual\" and having a fetish for transvestites - \"bringing transvestites home\"). It includes also the lyrics insulting Eminem's family, including his then-eight-year-old daughter Hailie Jade: \"Em you claim your mother's a crack head and Kim is a known slut, so what's Hailie gonna be when she grows up?\" Eminem, along with D12 and Obie Trice, responded with the track \"Doe Rae Me\" (aka \"Hailie's Revenge\").

      "In 2003, rapper and The Source co-owner Benzino released a diss single titled \"Pull Your Skirt Up\" which took aim at Eminem. The track attacked Eminem's \"street cred\" and accused him of being a tool of the music industry. Eminem had been discovered by The Source after writer Rigo Morales featured him in the magazine's famed monthly \"Unsigned Hype\" column.\n",
      "In the same year, The Source released an article written by Kimberly Osorio, which identified and researched the history of an old demo tape that the magazine discovered where Eminem insulted Black women and used the word \"nigger\". The demo featured a song called \"Foolish Pride\", recorded in the late 1980s when Eminem claimed to have been \"dumped\" by his African-American then-girlfriend. Eminem responded with two tracks titled \"Nail in the Coffin\" and \"The Sauce\". Benzino would later release more tracks. As a result of the conflict, Shady/Aftermath ads were pulled from the magazine. XXL, another hip hop magazine which had featured negative coverage of Shady/Aftermath artists since Eminem mocked them in his song \"Marshall Mathers\" from his 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP, stepped in to fill the void, accepting Shady/Aftermath ads.\n",

While \"Superman\" was released in 2003, Carey released a song entitled \"Clown\" on her album Charmbracelet, released in 2002, which makes similar references in line with her 2009 hit \"Obsessed\".\n",
      "Eminem's \"Bagpipes from Baghdad\" from his album Relapse disparages Carey and rapper/then-husband Nick Cannon's relationship. Cannon responded to Eminem by saying his career is based on \"racist bigotry\" and that he would get revenge on Eminem, joking that he may return to rapping. Eminem later stated that the couple misinterpreted the track and it was wishing the two the best. Cannon also stated that there were no hard feelings and that he just had to express his feelings about the song.In 2009, Carey released \"Obsessed\", about an obsessed man who claims to have been in a relationship with her. Cannon claimed that the song was not an insult directed at Eminem. However, Eminem responded in late July 2009 by releasing a track titled \"The Warning\". It contained samples of voice mail recordings which Eminem claimed were left by Carey, when the two were dating. Eminem also hinted that he had other evidence of their relationship in his possession. A little over a year later in September 2010, Cannon responded with the song \"I'm a Slick Rick\", making fun of Eminem.\n",

The song's title refers to Eminem's \"Rap God\" and Eminem went into the studio days later to record his own response, as did former D12 associate Bizarre. Eminem responded with \"Killshot\" on September 14 and Bizarre's \"Love Tap\" was released on September 20. \"Killshot\" garnered 38.1 million streams on YouTube in its first 24 hours and over 80 million views in its first week, making it the most successful debut for a hip hop song and the third-biggest debut in the platform's history.

      "Eminem had his first run-in with the law at age 20, when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun. The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court.On June 3, 2000, Eminem was arrested during an altercation with Douglas Dail at a car-audio store in Royal Oak, Michigan, when he pulled out an unloaded gun and pointed it at the ground. The next day, in Warren, Michigan, he was arrested again for assaulting John Guerra in the parking lot of the Hot Rock Café when he saw him kissing his wife. Eminem recreated the Guerra assault in \"The Kiss (Skit)\" on The Eminem Show. He pleaded guilty to possession of a concealed weapon and assault, receiving two years' probation; however, Guerra's assault charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement. On June 28, 2001, Eminem was sentenced to one year's probation and community service and was fined about $2,000 on weapon charges stemming from an argument with an employee of Psychopathic Records.In 1999, Eminem's mother sued him for $10 million, claiming he was slandering her on The Slim Shady LP. Litigation concluded in 2001, resulting in an award of $1,600 for her damages.On July 7, 2000, Kim Mathers attempted suicide by slitting her wrists, later suing Eminem for defamation after describing her violent death in \"Kim\".Sanitation worker DeAngelo Bailey sued Eminem for $1 million in 2001, accusing him of invading his privacy by publicizing information placing him in a false light in \"Brain Damage\", a song that portrays him as a violent school bully. Although Bailey admitted picking on Eminem in school, he said he merely \"bumped\" him and gave him a \"little shove\". The lawsuit was dismissed on October 20, 2003; Judge Deborah Servitto, who wrote a portion of her opinion in rap-like rhyming verse, ruled that it was clear to the public that the lyrics were exaggerated.On March 31, 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem and Dr. Dre, claiming that the beat for \"Kill You\" was taken from his instrumental \"Pulsion\". Loussier demanded that sales of The Marshall Mathers LP be halted and any remaining copies destroyed. The case was later settled out of court.In 2006, Eminem was accused of assaulting Miad Jarbou, a resident of Royal Oak, Michigan, in the bathroom of a Detroit strip club, but was never charged. Two years later, Jarbou sued Eminem for more than $25,000 in damages.In 2007, Eminem's music-publishing company (Eight Mile Style) and Martin Affiliated sued Apple Inc. and Aftermath Entertainment, claiming that Aftermath was not authorized to negotiate a deal with Apple for digital downloads of 93 Eminem songs on Apple's iTunes. The case against Apple was settled shortly after the trial began, in late September 2009.In July 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records that F.B.T. Productions and Eminem were owed a royalty of 50 percent of Aftermath's net revenue from licensing his recordings to companies such as Apple, Sprint Corporation, Nextel Communications, Cingular and T-Mobile. In March 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case.In October 2013, Eminem sampled Chicago-based rap group Hotstylz's 2008 viral hit, \"Lookin' Boy\", for his 2013 hit single \"Rap God\". The group claims that Eminem did not receive permission to use the sample, nor did he credit or compensate them. In November 2013, Hotstylz released a diss track towards Eminem titled \"Rap Fraud\", where they sample several of his songs and criticize him for not crediting them. In January 2015, TMZ reported that Hotstylz was suing Eminem and his label, Shady Records, for $8 million, for using the 25-second sample of \"Lookin' Boy\" on his song \"Rap God\" without their permission.\n",

Bush in \"We As Americans\" (an unreleased bootleg at the time), with the lyrics: \"Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead, it's never been said but I set precedents.\" The incident was included in the video for \"Mosh\", as a newspaper clipping on a wall with articles about unfortunate incidents in Bush's career. \"We As Americans\" eventually appeared on Encore's deluxe-edition bonus disc with altered lyrics. The original lyrics can be heard at the end of Immortal Technique's \"Bin Laden\".\n",
      "In 2018–2019, the Secret Service interviewed Eminem again regarding threatening lyrics towards president Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Allegations of homophobia ===\n",
      "Some of Eminem's lyrics have been criticized for being homophobic, and an Australian politician attempted to ban him from the country. Eminem denies the charge, saying that when he was growing up words such as \"faggot\" and \"queer\" were used generally in a derogatory manner and not specifically toward homosexuals. During a 2010 60 Minutes interview, journalist Anderson Cooper explored the issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "Eminem was accused yet again of using homophobic words in his lyrics in \"Rap God\" (2013) and explained \"I don't know how to say this without saying it how I've said it a million times. But that word, those kind of words, when I came up battle-rappin' or whatever, I never really equated those words ... (to actually mean homosexual)\".Eminem is a friend of gay singer Elton John, and publicly supports gay rights. When asked in an interview with The New York Times about the subject of same-sex marriage being legalized in his home state of Michigan, Eminem responded, \"I think if two people love each other, then what the hell? I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable, if they want\", explaining that his \"overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Canada ===\n",
      "On October 26, 2000, Eminem was scheduled to perform at Toronto's SkyDome when Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty said that Eminem should not be allowed to enter the country. \"I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women\", he said. Flaherty also said that he was \"disgusted\" when he read the lyrics of \"Kill You\", which includes the lines \"Slut, you think I won't choke no whore / Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?\" Although public reaction to Flaherty's position was generally negative, with barring Eminem from the country considered a free-speech issue, Liberal MPP Michael Bryant suggested that hate crime charges should be brought against Eminem for advocating violence against women in his lyrics. Robert Everett-Green wrote in a Globe and Mail editorial, \"Being offensive is Eminem's job description\". Eminem's Toronto concert went on as planned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Legacy ==\n",
      "Credited for popularizing hip hop to a Middle American audience, Eminem's unprecedented global commercial success and acclaimed works for a white rapper is widely recognized for breaking racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. Rising from rags to riches, Eminem's anger-fueled music represented widespread angst and the reality of American underclass. He has been greatly influential for artists of various genres.\n",
      "Stephen Hill, the then vice president of African American-themed television network BET (Black Entertainment Television), said in 2002:Eminem gets a pass in the same vein that back during segregation black folks had to be better than average, had to be the best, to be accepted ... he is better than the best. In his own way, he is the best lyricist, alliterator and enunciator out there in hip-hop music. In terms of rapping about the pain that other disenfranchised people feel, there is no one better at their game than Eminem.\n",
      "In 2002, the BBC said that the perception of Eminem as a \"modern-day William Shakespeare\" was comparable to the reception of American singer Bob Dylan: \"Not since Bob Dylan's heyday in the mid-1960s has an artist's output been subjected to such intense academic scrutiny as an exercise in contemporary soul-searching. US critics point to [Eminem's] vivid portraits of disenfranchised lives – using the stark, direct language of the street – as an accurate reflection of social injustice.\" In addition, the BBC highlighted that, \"Where parents once recoiled in horror [to his music], there now seems a greater willingness to acknowledge a music that is striking such a chord among the American young, angry white underclass.\" Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that Eminem during the early 2000s was \"the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.... he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation.\"Writing for Spin in 2002, rock critic Alan Light compared Eminem to the Beatles' John Lennon:\n",
      "\n",
      "Eminem is even starting to bear a resemblance to one of those rock icons ... Marshall Mathers is becoming something like this generation's John Lennon ... Lennon and Eminem were both subjects of pickets and protests; they both wrote songs about troubled relationships with their mothers; they both wrote about their strange public lives with their wives; they both wrote about how much they loved their kids. Lennon, of course, was able to find ways to use his voice to advocate for peace rather than just blasting away at litigious family members and various pop stars, but still, few other pop musicians since Lennon have found a way to render their private psychodramas into compelling art as effectively as Eminem.\n",
      "Regarding his rehearsal with Eminem for the \"Stan\" duet at the 2001 Grammy Awards, English singer Elton John said, \"[When] Eminem made his entrance, I got goose bumps, the likes of which I have not felt since I first saw Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. Eminem was that good. I just thought, 'Fuck, this man is amazing.' There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first time — only the greats.\" John further praised Eminem, saying, \"Eminem is a true poet of his time, someone we'll be talking about for decades to come. He tells stories in such a powerful and distinctive way. As a lyricist, he's one of the best ever. Eminem does for his audience what [Bob] Dylan did for his: He writes how he feels. His anger, vulnerability and humor come out.\"Concerning the controversy surrounding Eminem due to his transgressive music, American entertainer Madonna had said, \"I like the fact that Eminem is brash and angry and politically incorrect ... He's stirring things up, he's provoking a discussion, he's making people's blood boil. He's reflecting what's going on in society right now. That is what art is supposed to do.\" American musician Stevie Wonder also said, \"Rap to me is a modern blues – a statement of how and where people are at ... I think art is a reflection of our society, and people don't like to confront the realities in society ... But until we really confront the truth, we are going to have a Tupac or Eminem or Biggie Smalls to remind us about it – and thank God. They force people to look at realities in society.\"The previously mentioned Bob Dylan praised Eminem, along with other artists, in a 2022 interview with the Wall Street Journal.Eminem has been credited with boosting the careers of hip hop proteges such as 50 Cent, Yelawolf, Stat Quo, Royce da 5'9\", Cashis, Obie Trice, Bobby Creekwater, Boogie and hip hop groups such as D12 and Slaughterhouse. A number of artists have cited Eminem as an influence, including The Weeknd, Usher, Rae Sremmurd, Logic, Joyner Lucas, Lil Wayne, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar, Ed Sheeran, J. Cole, Chance the Rapper, Regina Spektor, Lana Del Rey, and Juice WRLD.\n",

      "Among Eminem's awards is 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards and 17 Billboard Music Awards, Billboard named him the \"Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)\". In 2013, he received the Global Icon Award at that year's MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony. His success in 8 Mile saw him win the 2002 Academy Award for Best Original Song for his song \"Lose Yourself\", co-written with Jeff Bass and Luis Resto, making him the first rapper to receive the award. He also won the MTV Movie & TV Awards for Best Actor in a Movie and Best Breakthrough Performance and the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song for \"Lose Yourself\".Eminem has also been included and ranked in several publications' lists. Rolling Stone included him in its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. He was ranked 9th on MTV's Greatest MCs of All Time list. He was ranked 13th on MTV's 22 Greatest Voices in Music list and 79th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All Time lists. He was ranked 82nd on Rolling Stone's \"The Immortals\" list. In 2010, MTV Portugal ranked Eminem the 7th biggest icon in popular music history. In 2012, The Source ranked him 6th on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time, while About.com ranked him 7th on its list of the 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987–2007). In 2015, Eminem was placed third on \"The 10 Best Rappers of All Time\" list by Billboard. In 2008, Vibe readers named Eminem the Best Rapper Alive. In 2011, Eminem was labeled the \"King of Hip-Hop\" by Rolling Stone based on an analysis of album sales, chart positions, YouTube views, social media following, concert grosses, industry awards and critical ratings of solo rappers who released music from 2009 to the first half of 2011.\n",

      "O'Shea Jackson Sr. (born June 15, 1969), better known as Ice Cube, is an American rapper, songwriter, actor, and film producer. His lyrics on N.W.A's 1988 album Straight Outta Compton contributed to gangsta rap's widespread popularity, and his political rap solo albums AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted (1990), Death Certificate (1991), and The Predator (1992) were all critically and commercially successful. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of N.W.A in 2016.A native of Los Angeles, Ice Cube formed his first rap group called C.I.A. in 1986. In 1987, with Eazy-E and Dr. Dre, he formed the gangsta rap group N.W.A. As its lead rapper, he wrote some of Dre's and most of Eazy's lyrics on Straight Outta Compton, a landmark album that shaped West Coast hip hop's early identity and helped differentiate it from East Coast rap. N.W.A was also known for their violent lyrics, threatening to attack abusive police which stirred controversy. After a monetary dispute over the group's management by Eazy-E and Jerry Heller, Cube left N.W.A in late 1989, teaming with New York artists and launching a solo rap career.Ice Cube has also had an active film career since the early 1990s. He entered cinema by playing Doughboy in director John Singleton's feature debut Boyz n the Hood, a 1991 drama named after a 1987 rap song that Ice Cube wrote. He also co-wrote and starred in the 1995 comedy film Friday, which spawned a successful franchise and reshaped his public image into a bankable movie star. He made his directorial debut with the 1998 film The Players Club, and also produced and curated the film's accompanying soundtrack. As of 2020, he has appeared in about 40 films, including the 1999 war comedy Three Kings, family comedies like the Barbershop series, and buddy cop comedies 21 Jump Street, 22 Jump Street, and Ride Along. He was an executive producer of many of these films, as well as of the 2015 biopic Straight Outta Compton.\n",

      "== Early life ==\n",
      "Ice Cube was born O'Shea Jackson in Los Angeles on June 15, 1969, the son of hospital clerk and custodian Doris and machinist and UCLA groundskeeper Hosea Jackson. He has an older brother, and they had a half-sister who was murdered when Cube was 12. He is the cousin of fellow rappers Del tha Funky Homosapien and Kam. He grew up on Van Wick Street in the Westmont section of South Los Angeles. In ninth grade at George Washington Preparatory High School in Los Angeles, Cube began writing raps after being challenged by his friend \"Kiddo\" in typewriting class. Kiddo lost. He has said that his stage name came from his older brother, who \"threatened to slam [him] into a freezer and pull [him] out when [he] was an ice cube\".Cube also attended William Howard Taft High School in the Woodland Hills area of Los Angeles. He was bused 40 miles to the suburban school from his home in a high-crime neighborhood. In the fall of 1987, soon after he wrote and recorded a few locally successful rap songs with N.W.A, he enrolled at the Phoenix Institute of Technology Phoenix, Arizona. In 1988, with a diploma in architectural drafting, he returned to Los Angeles and rejoined N.W.A, but kept a career in architecture drafting as a backup plan.\n",

      "=== Early work ===\n",
      "In 1986, at the age of 16, Ice Cube began rapping in the trio C.I.A. but soon joined the newly formed rap group N.W.A. He was N.W.A's lead rapper and main ghostwriter on its official debut album, 1988's Straight Outta Compton. Due to a financial dispute, he left the group by the start of 1990. During 1990, his debut solo album, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, found him also leading a featured rap group, Da Lench Mob. Meanwhile, he helped develop the rapper Yo Yo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 1986: C.I.A. ===\n",
      "With friend Sir Jinx, Ice Cube formed the rap group C.I.A., and performed at parties hosted by Dr. Dre. Since 1984, Dre was a member of a popular DJ crew, the World Class Wreckin' Cru, which by 1985 was also performing and recording electro rap. Dre had Cube help write the Wreckin Cru's hit song \"Cabbage Patch\". Dre also joined Cube on a side project, a duo called Stereo Crew, which made a 12-inch record, \"She's a Skag\", released on Epic Records in 1986.In 1987, C.I.A. released the Dr. Dre-produced single \"My Posse\". Meanwhile, the Wreckin' Cru's home base was the Eve After Dark nightclub, about a quarter of a mile outside of the city of Compton in Los Angeles county. While Dre was on the turntable, Ice Cube would rap, often parodying other artists' songs. In one instance, Cube's rendition was \"My Penis\", parodying Run-DMC's \"My Adidas\". In 2015, the nightclub's co-owner and Wreckin' leader Alonzo Williams would recall feeling his reputation damaged by this and asking it not to be repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 1986–1989: N.W.A. ===\n",
      "\n",
      "At 16, Cube sold his first song to Eric Wright, soon dubbed Eazy-E, who was forming Ruthless Records and the musical team N.W.A, based in Compton, California. Himself from South Central Los Angeles, Cube would be N.W.A's only core member not born in Compton.\n",
      "Upon the success of the song \"Boyz-n-the-Hood\"—written by Cube, produced by Dre, and rapped by Eazy-E, helping establish gangsta rap in California—Eazy focused on developing N.W.A, which soon gained MC Ren. Cube wrote some of Dre's and nearly all of Eazy's lyrics on N.W.A's official debut album, Straight Outta Compton, released in August 1988. Yet by late 1989, Cube questioned his compensation and N.W.A's management by Jerry Heller.Cube also wrote most of Eazy-E's debut album Eazy-Duz-It. He received a total pay of $32,000, and the contract that Heller presented in 1989 did not confirm that he was officially an N.W.A member. After leaving the group and its label in December, Cube sued Heller, and the lawsuit was later settled out of court. In response, N.W.A members attacked Cube on the 1990 EP 100 Miles and Runnin', and on N.W.A's next and final album, Niggaz4Life, in 1991.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 1989–1993: Early solo career, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, Death Certificate, and The Predator ===\n",
      "In early 1990, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, in New York with iconic rap group Public Enemy's production team, the Bomb Squad. Arriving in May 1990, it was an instant hit, further swelling rap's mainstream integration. Controversial nonetheless, it drew accusations of misogyny and racism. The album introduces Ice Cube's affirmation of black nationalism and ideology of black struggle.\n",
      "Cube appointed Yo-Yo, a female rapper and guest on the album, to be the head of his record label, and helped produce her debut album, Make Way for the Motherlode. Also in 1990, Cube followed up with an EP—Kill At Will—critically acclaimed, and rap's first EP certified Platinum.His second album Death Certificate was released in 1991. The album thought to as more focused, yet even more controversial, triggering accusations of anti-white, antisemitic, and misogynist content. The album was split into two themes: the Death Side, \"a vision of where we are today\", and the Life Side, \"a vision of where we need to go\". The track \"No Vaseline\" scathingly retorts insults directed at him by N.W.A's 1990 EP and 1991 album, which call him a traitor. Besides calling for hanging Eazy-E as a \"house nigga\", the track blames N.W.A's manager Jerry Heller for exploiting the group, mentions that he is a Jew, and calls for his murder. Ice Cube contended that he mentioned Heller's ethnicity merely incidentally, not to premise attack, but as news media mention nonwhite assailants' races. The track \"Black Korea\", also deemed racist, was also thought as foreseeing the 1992 Los Angeles riots. While controversial, Death Certificate broadened his audience; he toured with Lollapalooza in 1992.\n",
      "Cube's third album, The Predator, was released in November 1992. Referring to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, the song \"Wicked\" opens, \"April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel.\" The Predator was the first album ever to debut at No. 1 on both the R&B/hip-hop and pop charts. Singles include \"It Was a Good Day\" and \"Check Yo Self\", songs having a \"two-part\" music video. Generally drawing critical praise, the album is his most successful commercially, over three million copies sold in the US. After this album, Cube's rap audience severely diminished, and never regained the prominence of his first three albums.During this time, Cube began to have numerous features on other artists' songs. In 1992, Cube appeared on Del the Funky Homosapien's debut album I Wish My Brother George Was Here, on Da Lench Mob's debut Guerillas in tha Mist, which he also produced, and on the Kool G Rap and DJ Polo song \"Two to the Head\". In 1993, he worked on Kam's debut album, and collaborated with Ice-T on the track \"Last Wordz\" on 2Pac's album Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z..\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== 1993–1998: Lethal Injection and forming Westside Connection ===\n",
      "Cube's fourth album, Lethal Injection, came out in late 1993. Here, Cube borrowed from the then-popular G-funk popularized by Dr. Dre. Although not received well by critics, the album brought successful singles, including \"Really Doe\", \"Bop Gun (One Nation)\", \"You Know How We Do It\", and \"What Can I Do?\" After this album, Ice Cube effectively lost his rap audience.Following Lethal Injection, Cube focused on films and producing albums of other rappers, including Da Lench Mob, Mack 10, Mr. Short Khop, and Kausion. In 1994, Cube teamed with onetime N.W.A groupmate Dr. Dre, who was then leading rap's G-funk subgenre, for the first time since Cube had left the group, and which had disbanded upon Dre's 1991 departure. The result was the Cube and Dre song \"Natural Born Killaz\", on the Murder Was The Case soundtrack, released by Dre's then-new label, Death Row Records.\n",
      "In 1995, Cube joined Mack 10 and WC in forming a side trio, the Westside Connection. Feeling neglected by East Coast media, a longstanding issue in rap's bicoastal rivalry, the group aimed to reinforce West pride and resonate with the undervalued. The Westside Connection's first album, Bow Down (1996), featured tracks like \"Bow Down\" and \"Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round\" that reflected the group's objectives. The album was certified Platinum by year's end. Interpreting rapper Common's song \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\" as a diss of West Coast rap, Cube and the Westside Connection briefly feuded with him, but they resolved amicably in 1997.It was also at this time that Cube began collaborating outside the rap genre. In 1997, he worked with David Bowie and Nine Inch Nails singer Trent Reznor on a remix of Bowie's \"I'm Afraid of Americans\". In 1998, Cube was featured on the band Korn's song \"Children of the Korn\", and joined them on their Family Values Tour 1998.\n",

      "\n",
      "=== 1998–2006: War & Peace Vol. 1 & 2 and Westside Connection reunion ===\n",
      "In November 1998, Cube released his long-awaited fifth solo album War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc). The delayed sixth album, Volume 2, arrived in 2000. These albums feature the Westside Connection and a reunion with his old N.W.A members Dr. Dre and MC Ren. Cube also received a return favor from Korn, as they appeared on his song \"Fuck Dying\" from Vol. 1. Many fans maintained that these two albums, especially the second, were lesser in quality to his earlier work. In 2000, Cube also joined Dr. Dre, Eminem, and Snoop Dogg for the Up in Smoke Tour.In 2002, Cube appeared on British DJ Paul Oakenfold's solo debut album, Bunkka, on the track \"Get Em Up\".\n",
      "Released in 2003, Westside Connection's second album, Terrorist Threats, fared well critically, but saw lesser sales. \"Gangsta Nation\" (featuring Nate Dogg), the only single released, was a radio hit. After a rift between Cube and Mack 10 about Cube's film work minimizing the group's touring, the Westside Connection disbanded in 2005.\n",
      "In 2004, Cube featured on the song \"Real Nigga Roll Call\" by Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz, the then leaders of rap's crunk subgenre.\n",

      "== Film and television career ==\n",
      "Since 1991, Ice Cube has acted in nearly 40 films, several of which are highly regarded. Some of them, such as the 1992 thriller Trespass and the 1999 war comedy Three Kings, highlight action. Yet most are comedies, including a few adult-oriented ones, like the Friday franchise, whereas most of these are family-friendly, like the Barbershop franchise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Narrative ===\n",
      "John Singleton's seminal film Boyz n the Hood, released in July 1991, debuted the actor Ice Cube playing Doughboy, a persona that Cube played convincingly. Later, Cube starred with Ice-T and Bill Paxton in Walter Hill's 1992 thriller film Trespass, and in Charles Burnett's 1995 film The Glass Shield. Meanwhile, Cube declined to costar with Janet Jackson in Singleton's 1993 romance Poetic Justice, a role that Tupac Shakur then played.\n",
      "Cube starred as the university student Fudge in Singleton's 1995 film Higher Learning. Singleton, encouraging Cube, had reportedly told him, \"If you can write a record, you can write a movie.\" Cube cowrote the screenplay for the 1995 comedy Friday, based on adult themes, and starred in it with comedian Chris Tucker. Made with $3.5 million, Friday drew $28 million worldwide. Two sequels, Next Friday and Friday After Next, were respectively released in 2000 and 2002.\n",
      "In 1997, playing a South African exiled to America who returns 15 years later, Cube starred in the action thriller Dangerous Ground, and had a supporting role in Anaconda. In 1998, writing again, the director Ice Cube debuted in The Players Club. In 1999, he starred alongside George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg as a staff sergeant in Three Kings, set in the immediate aftermath of the Gulf War, whereby the United States attacked Iraq in 1990, an \"intelligent\" war comedy critically acclaimed. In 2002, Cube starred in Kevin Bray's All About the Benjamins, and in Tim Story's comedy film Barbershop.\n",
      "In 2004, Cube played in Barbershop 2 and Torque. The next year, he replaced Vin Diesel in the second installment of the XXX film series, XXX: State of the Union, as the main protagonist, which he reprises the character in the third installment and reunited with Diesel 12 years later, XXX: Return of Xander Cage. He also appeared in the family comedy Are We There Yet?, which premised his role in its 2007 sequel Are We Done Yet?. In 2012, Cube appeared in 21 Jump Street. He also appeared in its sequel, 22 Jump Street, in 2014. That year, and then to return in 2016, he played alongside comedian Kevin Hart in two more Tim Story films, Ride Along and Ride Along 2. Also in 2016, Cube returned for the third entry in the Barbershop series. And in 2017, Cube starred with Charlie Day in the comedy Fist Fight.\n",
      "In October 2021, Ice Cube was set to star in the comedy film Oh Hell No (now titled Stepdude) alongside Jack Black, but left the project after refusing to get vaccinated for COVID-19. The project would have paid him $9 million.\n",

      "=== Documentary ===\n",
      "In late 2005, Ice Cube and R. J. Cutler co-created the six-part documentary series Black. White., carried by cable network FX.\n",
      "Ice Cube and basketball star LeBron James paired up to pitch a one-hour special to ABC based on James's life.On May 11, 2010, ESPN aired Cube's directed documentary Straight Outta L.A., examining the interplay of Los Angeles sociopolitics, hip hop, and the Raiders during the 1980s into the 1990s.\n",

      "=== Serial television ===\n",
      "Ice Cube's Are We There Yet? series premiered on TBS on June 2, 2010. It revolves around a family adjusting to the matriarch's new husband, played by Terry Crews. On August 16, the show was renewed for 90 more episodes, amounting to six seasons. Cube also credits Tyler Perry for his entrée to TBS. In front of the television cameras, rather, Cube appeared with Elmo as a 2014 guest on the PBS children's show Sesame Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Personal life ==\n",
      "In 1990, a musical associate in the rap group Public Enemy introduced Cube to the Nation of Islam (NOI). He converted to Islam, though he denied membership in the NOI, whose ideology against white people and especially Jews led to its categorization as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. However, he readily adopted the group's ideology of black nationalism, a concept familiar to the hip hop community. He nevertheless has claimed to listen his own conscience as a \"natural Muslim\", claiming to do so because \"it's just [him] and God\". In 2012, he expressed support for same-sex marriage. In 2017, he said that he thinks \"religion is stupid\" in part and explained, \"I'm gonna live a long life, and I might change religions three or four times before I die. I'm on the Islam tip—but I'm on the Christian tip, too. I'm on the Buddhist tip as well. Everyone has something to offer to the world.\"Ice Cube has been married to Kimberly Woodruff since April 26, 1992. They have five children together; their oldest son O'Shea Jackson Jr. (born 1991) portrayed him in the film Straight Outta Compton. When asked about the balance between his music and parenting in 2005, Cube discussed teaching his children to question the value of violence depicted in all media, not just song lyrics. Through His Son O'Shea Jackson Jr. Ice Cube is a Grandfather. In a 2016 interview, Cube cited Jaws as his favorite film and named \"It Was a Good Day\" as being among his favorite of his own songs. Commercially, he has endorsed Coors Light beer and St. Ides malt liquor, and licensed a clothing line called Solo by Cube. In 2017, he launched Big3, a 3-on-3 basketball league starring former NBA players.Ice Cube is a notable fan of the Las Vegas Raiders, originally supporting the team during their tenure in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994. NWA's use of Raiders' memorabilia in conjunction with the team's historically intimidating presence, helped to further popularized an image for the team in hip-hop culture for years to come. Ice Cube is also a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers of the MLB, and has equally been a devout fan of the Los Angeles Lakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Conspiracy theories and antisemitism ===\n",
      "At a 1991 press conference promoting his album Death Certificate, Cube endorsed the Nation of Islam's pseudo-scholarly book The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews, which falsely claims that European Jews dominated the Atlantic slave trade. Death Certificate also contains the song \"No Vaseline\", which uses racial slurs against the other former members of N.W.A and refers to the group's manager Jerry Heller as \"white man\", \"white boy\", \"Jew\", \"devil\", \"white Jew\", and \"cracker\". In 1991, Ice Cube was questioned during an interview with Barbara Nevins-Taylor on CNBC's Talk Live about whether his fans should take him literally when he sings about \"shooting a Jew\" in \"No Vaseline\". In response to accusations of racism and anti-Semitism, Cube said in 2008, \"I ain't got time to be fuckin' anti-Semitic, anti-this, anti-that, anti-Korean. I ain't got time for that shit. I'm too busy bein' pro-black, you know what I'm saying?\"In 2015, Cube expressed regret at including the word \"Jew\" in the lyrics of \"No Vaseline\" and explained that he intended to attack only Heller and not \"the whole Jewish race\". However, that same year, he was sued for allegedly ordering the assault of a rabbi. During the assault, which he denied instigating, he reportedly uttered anti-Semitic slurs against the rabbi for wearing a yarmulke.In 2020, Marlow Stern wrote an article in the Daily Beast addressing Cube's \"long, disturbing history\" of anti-Semitism. The article was a response to Cube's day-long Twitter posting spree the day before, during which he promoted Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and posted an image of the allegedly anti-Semitic mural Freedom for Humanity with the caption \"Fuck the new normal until they fix the old normal!\" He also shared various disproven anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Again calling himself \"just pro-black\" and not \"anti-anybody\", he dismissed \"the hype\" and professed that he was just \"telling [his] truth\".\n",
